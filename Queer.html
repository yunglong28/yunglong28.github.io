    <p id="lo1"><span id="drop">From</span> the very beginning, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span></a> came bearing something radical and new: a sound that had not been heard before, and a vision that peered up out of the present moment, periscope-like, in search of the unknown. <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> knew that the future is fragile: It’s not just that so many <span class="event" about="Tomorrowland">Tomorrowland</span> fantasies turn to kitsch but that the very idea of musical futurism, once so central to <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> and the avant-garde alike, has become a relic. Culture’s ability to see past the horizon has become increasingly eclipsed by its addiction to the past. But <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>, who died on <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/sophie-has-died/"> Saturday, January 30</a>, at the age of 34, was not afflicted with that myopia.</p>

<p>Across a string of singles, a handful of collaborations, and one staggering album, the <span class="key" about="music">music</span> of the Scottish-born artist combined <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> instincts, uncompromisingly experimental musical ideas, formidable programming chops, and a self-presentation that was at once mischievous and movingly guileless. The result was a body of work that was essentially hopeful, like a roadmap to a better world in which to be vulnerable was, ironically, synonymous with becoming indestructible. That <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> died from an accidental fall in <span class="place" about="Athens" data-wikidata-id="Q1524" data-label="Athens">Athens</span>, <span class="place" about="Greece" data-wikidata-id="Q41" data-label="Greece">Greece</span>, having attempted to climb to a higher vantage point in order to view the full moon, is an ending that feels as surreal as modern myth.</p>
    <p><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>, who preferred not to use gendered or nonbinary pronouns, appeared in 2012 with “<span class="song" about="NothingMoretoSay">Nothing More to Say</span>,” a sparkling take on club <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span>. But it was the following year’s “<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15625-sophie-bipp/"><span class="song" about="Bipp">BIPP</span></a>,” a single for <span class="place" about="Scotland">Scotland</span>’s <span class="label" about="Numbers">Numbers</span> label, that would establish the head-spinning newness of <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s sound. The song remains as breathtaking now as it was then. It sounds like a bouncy castle full of thumbtacks, giddily irresistible and faintly dangerous, full of pitch-bent <span class="key" about="synths">synths</span> that simulate the light-headed feeling of coming up on ecstasy. The lead vocal is like ’80s freestyle music on helium; pipsqueak backing shouts lend to the cartoonish air. The <span class="key" about="hyper-digital">hyper-digital</span> synths share a similar approach to maximalist peers like <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"><span class="person" about="Rustie">Rustie</span></a> and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"><span class="person" about="HudsonMohawke">Hudson Mohawke</span></a>, but where their productions jammed the stereo field, “<span class="song" about="Bipp">BIPP</span>” takes place against a backdrop of empty space, like a bouquet of fluorescent bungee cords snapping in a vacuum.</p>

<p><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> was developing a new tonal language. In a 2012 interview with <a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/expanded-benefits-matthew-lutz-kinoy-and-sophie/"><span class="magazine" about="BombMagazine">Bomb Magazine</span></a>, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> described that this music should offer “the same sort of high-thrill three-minute ride as a theme park roller coaster. Where it spins you upside down, dips you in water, flashes strobe lights at you, takes you on a slow incline to the peak, and then drops you vertically down a smokey tunnel, then stops with a jerk, and your hair is all messed up, and some people feel sick, and others are laughing—then you buy a key ring.” <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s music may have shared stylistic DNA with <span class="genre" about="dubstep">dubstep</span>, <span class="genre" about="electro">electro</span>, and <span class="genre" about="house">house</span>, but the production had a visceral, tactile quality all its own. It felt as much sculptural as musical, and the sound design—those earthshaking bass jolts and sky-piercing mercury bolts—was nothing short of otherworldly, not obviously analog or digital in origin, but some third, exploratory thing.</p>
<p><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s signature was not limited to this hyperkinetic palette; the songs’ pitched-up vocals played fast and loose with <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span>’s expressive capabilities. On 2014’s “<span class="song" about="Lemonade">LEMONADE</span>,” they were frisky and borderline nonsensical; on “<span class="song" about="Hard">HARD</span>,” they were aggressively flirtatious. (“Latex gloves, smack so hard/PVC, I get so hard/Platform shoes kick so hard/Ponytail, yank so hard”—it’s safe to say that chipmunk vocals have never sounded quite so sexy as they did here.) But the most powerful lyrics could be strikingly sincere. The main hook of “<span class="song" about="Bipp">BIPP</span>”—“I can make you feel better/If you let me”—could have been taken as a sly come-on. Heard another way, it offers a shoulder to cry on.</p>
<p><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> wasn’t alone in this pursuit. In the early 2010s, the avant-<span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> collective <span class="label" about="PCMusic">PC Music</span> was also exploring similar sounds and themes, and <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> collaborated with <span class="label" about="PCMusic">PC Music</span>’s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32520-a-g-cook/"></a><span class="person" about="AGCook">A. G. Cook</span></a> and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32470-qt/"><span class="person" about="QuinnThomas">Quinn Thomas</span></a> on 2014’s "<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17065-qt-hey-qt/"><span class="song" about="HeyQT">Hey QT</span></a>,” a theme song for an imaginary energy drink. But <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s solo work from this period had a particular focus. For all the music’s spark, there wasn’t a single wasted gesture, not an ounce of excess. The project’s ideology extended to the sleeves of the early singles, in which brightly rendered water slides took on the appearance of cryptic glyphs. Their undulating shapes and fluorescent hues signified joy, artifice, and eros; they suggested children’s water parks, prosthetic devices, and sex toys. (An edition of <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s 2015 singles collection <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21212-product/"><span class="album" about="Product">PRODUCT</span></a> even came packaged with a “<a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/61411-sophie-releasing-singles-collection-with-silicon-product-that-sure-looks-like-a-sex-toy/">silicon product</a>” with unambiguous contours.)</p>

<p>All this impish behavior led some critics to question <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s motives, and it’s true that they weren’t always clear. When <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/sophie-producer-interview/">asked</a> what genre of music <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> made, the artist responded: “advertising.” In 2015, when “<span class="song" about="Lemonade">LEMONADE</span>” got licensed for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTYITNM1K-s">McDonald’s commercial</a>, some saw it as a capitulation to the marketplace—or, worse, as proof that <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s music was somehow compromised by its proximity to capital. In fact, the commercial placement only underscored <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s unwillingness to be constrained by conventional binaries. To <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>, there was no reason one should not use any avenue available to bring adventurous music to a mass public. “An experimental idea doesn’t have to be separated from a mainstream context,” <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/01/profile-sophie.html">said</a>. “The really exciting thing is where those two things are together. That’s where you can get real change.” And <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> music benefited greatly from <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s daring.</p>
<p>Soon the artist’s discography quickly filled up with collaborations. Producing <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"><span class="person" about="CharliXCX">Charli XCX</span></a>’s 2016 EP <span class="album" about="VroomVroom">Vroom Vroom</span>, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> tapped into the UK singer’s knowingly self-aware <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> to deliver something both iconoclastic and devilishly effective. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"><span class="person" about="VinceStaples">Vince Staples</span></a> availed himself of <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s molten-metal sound design on 2017’s “<span class="song" about="YeahRight">Yeah Right</span>”—a tacit admission that <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> could go as hard as any revered <span class="genre" about="rap">rap</span> producer. And other high-profile cosigns—like <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"><span class="person" about="Madonna">Madonna</span></a>’s “<span class="song" about="BitchImMadonna">Bitch I’m Madonna</span>,” which <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> co-wrote with <span class="person" about="Ariel">Ariel Rechtshaid</span>, <span class="person" about="Diplo">Diplo</span>, <span class="person" about="Mozella">Mozella</span> (of <span class="person" about="MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</span>’ “<span class="song" about="Wrecking">Wrecking Ball</span>”), and <span class="person" about="Toby">Toby Gad</span> —suggested the extent to which the mainstream <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> industry was racing to appropriate <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s vision. From today’s vantage point, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s work from this period looks even more prescient, both conceptually and formally. It’s hard to imagine <span class="genre" about="hyperpop">hyperpop</span> existing in its current form without <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>. “it’s impossible to overstate the influence  <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">sophie</span> had on me and countless others, musically and otherwise,” 100 gecs’ <span class="person" about="LauraLes">Laura Les</span> wrote in tribute. “we’re still going to be catching up to [sophie] for years to come.”</p>
<p>Even as mainstream <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> chased after <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s singular energy, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> traveled deeper into leftfield artists and sounds. Last year saw collaborations with the <span class="place" about="Uk">UK </span>rapper <span class="person" about="Shygirl">Shygirl</span> and the queer teenaged Chicago rapper <span class="person" about="KiddKenn">Kidd Kenn</span>; a collaboration with experimental footwork producer <span class="person" about="Jlin">Jlin</span>, commissioned by <span class="event" about="UnsoundFestival">Poland’s Unsound festival</span>, will come out this spring. Those who worked with <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> tend to recall the artist’s genius, gentleness, and generosity. The <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> producer <span class="person" about="Benny">Benny Blanco</span> rhapsodized on Twitter about the way that <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> managed to wring otherworldly sounds out of even the most old-school pieces of gear. <span class="person" about="Arca">Arca</span> wrote simply, “growing alongside you helped me feel less alone throughout the years. I will miss our correspondence very much. to have been a part of each others’ journey, to have made music with you remains a formative experience that I will always cherish.”</p>

<p>For a long while, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s identity remained a mystery; an initially anonymous public profile led some to lump the artist in with acts like <span class="person" about="Karenn">Karenn</span>, <span class="person" about="Patricia">Patricia</span>, and <span class="person" about="SuzanneKraft">Suzanne Kraft</span>—cis-male producers who had adopted conventionally female names. But in 2017, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> stepped out from behind the curtain. The video for “<span class="song" about="ItsOkaytCry">It’s Okay to Cry</span>” marked the first time <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> had intentionally appeared in photographs or on video, aside from blurry photos behind the decks. The artist’s glossy red lips, red ringlets, sculpted cheekbones, and graceful choreography, at once coquettish and sad, immediately announced the arrival of a striking new figure. cA <span class="magazine" abou="Volture">Vulture</span> profile by <span class="person" about="SashaGeffen">Sasha Geffen </span> that same year noted that despite the abundance of queer and trans signifiers in <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s work, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> saw no need to elaborate regarding the artist’s own gender or sexuality. “The loosening of gender boundaries feels central, not incidental, to <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s music,” wrote <span class="person" about="SashaGeffen">Geffen</span>, “which is maybe why [<span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>] doesn’t feel the need to talk about it.” In a Paper interview the following year, however, <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> opened up. Asked about the effects of “embracing being a trans girl,” <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> elaborated, “An embrace of the essential idea of transness changes everything because it means there's no longer an expectation based on the body you were born into, or how your life should play out and how it should end.” </p>

<p>
  “It’s Okay to Cry” was a marked shift in SOPHIE’s work. A pastiche of the saccharine ballads that have powered middle-school slow dances since time immemorial, it was the poppiest—and most unabashedly sentimental—SOPHIE had ever sounded. The subsequent singles showed the artist to be three steps ahead of everyone else, as usual. “<span about="Ponyboy">Ponyboy</span>” was a celebration of kink framed by concussive blasts and elephantine squeals, while “<span about="Faceshopping">Faceshopping</span>,” as brutal a song as the post-dubstep era has produced, went to the heart of SOPHIE’s interest in the twinned essence of artifice and identity: “My face is the front of shop/My face is the real shop front/My shop is the face I front/I’m real when I shop my face.” Those three songs comprised the opening salvo of 2018’s Grammy-nominated <span about="oil">OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES</span>, SOPHIE’s debut LP, and they were fleshed out with the artist’s most visionary work yet.

<p>
  But it’s the album’s final track that feels like it should be the album’s opener: “<span about="WholeNewWorld" class="song">Whole New World/Pretend World</span>” is a militant march of supersaw stabs, violent digital percussion, and defiant chants of “Whole new world.” I remember the way the song shook the foundations of Barcelona’s <span class="event" about="SonarFestival" >Sónar festival </span> when SOPHIE played there in 2018. It felt like a shot across the bow, a fight song, a greased-up latex gauntlet—a promise and a threat all in one. Toward the end of the set, SOPHIE lowered the straps on a lycra top and stood in the spotlight, breasts proudly exposed.
</p>

<p>Transness was an essential part of <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s futurism; it was a way of reconciling all manner of binaries—not just male and female but also being and becoming, questions and answers, artifice and authenticity—in the pursuit of a more perfect world. A "<span class="song" about="WholeNewWorld">Whole New World</span>",” a “<span class="song" about="PretendWorld">Pretend World</span>”—what’s the difference? For <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>, <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> music offered a platform for taking imaginative play and turning it into something as serious as your life, and vice-versa. <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s project was utopian. As <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span> told Paper, “For me, transness is taking control to bring your body more in line with your soul and spirit so the two aren't fighting against each other and struggling to survive.”</p>

<p><span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s journey from a formerly anonymous and frequently misgendered figure to one of <span class="genre" about="pop">pop</span> culture’s most visible trans artists spoke to a fundamental hope—a path to a world beyond prejudice or stigma, where every individual is free to inhabit the identity they choose. <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s art, likewise, was about the boundlessness of unfettered creative potential. Futurism, for <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>, wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was a question of empathy, an invitation to embrace the becoming of a better self. <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>’s music placed all its bets on the future. It hurts to imagine a future without <span class="person" about="Sophie" data-label="Sophie" data-wikidata-id="Q18161827">SOPHIE</span>.</p>

<p id="lo2"><span id="drop">In</span> late August, the singer, songwriter, and guitarist <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Adrianne Lenker</span> stood beside a creek in upstate <span class="place" about="NewYork" data-wikidata-id="Q1384" data-label="New York">New York </span> watching the water move. The day before, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>, who is twenty-nine, had packed up the<span class="place" about="NewYork" data-wikidata-id="Q1384" data-label="New York">New York </span> <span class="place" about="Brooklyn" data-wikidata-id="Q18419" data-label="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span> apartment she’d been sharing with two roommates. She was preparing to haul a vintage camping trailer across the country to <span class="place" about="TopangaCanyon" data-wikidata-id="Q85877798" data-label="Topanga Canyon">Topanga Canyon</span>, on the west side of <span class="place" about="LosAngeles" data-wikidata-id="Q65" data-label="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</span>, where her band, <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-ordinary-brilliance-of-big-thief">Big Thief</a></span>, was planning to meet up. For the next couple of months, at least, the trailer would be home.</p>
<p>Moving can be disorienting—all that sorting and boxing and tossing out forces a kind of self-reckoning—and for <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> the
experience was only intensified by the ongoing anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, which made imagining any sort of future feel
optimistic, if not naïve. The exhaustion and sorrow of the spring had left everyone feeling precarious. The sun refracted against the
surface of the creek until the water turned black. Our conversation drifted toward the Zen idea of impermanence. “Is it too early
for this?” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> joked. “Nice to meet you—let’s talk about death.”</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> had spent the past few weeks recording with <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> at a home studio in the <span class="place" about="CatskillMountains" data-wikidata-id="Q20054657" data-label="Catskill Mountains">Catskill Mountains</span>, run by the musicians
<span class="person" about="SamOwens">Sam Owens</span> and <span class="person" about="HannahCohen">Hannah Cohen</span>. The rest of the band—the guitarist <span class="person" about="BuckMeek">Buck Meek</span>, the bassist <span class="person" about="MaxOleartchik" data-label="Max Oleartchik" data-wikidata-id="Q16133342">Max Oleartchik</span>, and the drummer <span class="person" about="JamesKrivchenia">James Krivchenia</span>—had since left, but <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> stuck around to renovate the trailer. She had just ordered a twin mattress, a portable
woodstove, and new linens.</p>
<p>This month, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> will release two solo albums: <span class="album" about="Songs">“Songs,”</span> a collection of tender, harmonically complex <span about="folk">folk</span> tunes, and
<span class="album" about="Instrumentals">“Instrumentals,”</span> which is composed of a pair of slowly unfolding guitar pieces. She made the records simultaneously, at a remote
cabin in <span class="place" about="NewEngland" data-wikidata-id="Q18389" data-label="New England">New England</span>, in the early, panicked days of both the pandemic and a breakup. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> is a quick and instinctive writer,
and even under normal circumstances her songs are raw and unfussy—it can feel as if they were dug up whole, like a carrot from
the garden. She sometimes speaks about writing as a kind of conjuring. “She gives a lot of significance to that moment where she’s
holding the guitar,” <span class="person" about="MaxOleartchik" data-label="Max Oleartchik" data-wikidata-id="Q16133342">Oleartchik</span> told me. “I never really think of her, like, fucking around and playing riffs or something. It’s always
this instrument of witchcraft. It’s always holy. She writes music from this place that’s very intuitive and fearless, and she has
confidence that there’s some kind of spirit or force that she can listen to.”</p>
<p>Before <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> vacated her apartment in New York, she had to paint over an illustration that her ex-girlfriend had drawn on the
bedroom wall. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> took some solace from the idea that the image wouldn’t be erased, exactly—it remained, even if she couldn’t
see it anymore. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> has been in romantic relationships with men and with women, and doesn’t feel any particular obligation to
outline her sexuality in precise terms, though she is comfortable being called queer. “The fact that there’s still people against that
kind of stuff makes the words necessary,” she told me. “But hopefully we move into a place where it’s, like, You’re what? Why are
you saying what you are?”</p>
<p>The wounds from the breakup were still pretty tender. “There’s a fullness that happens when someone is focussed on you,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>
said. “For me, if I’m being fully looked at and paid attention to and seen, I’m filled up by that.” She continued, “Now there isn’t
anyone to text; there are no love messages coming through. I feel so empty. There’s a song on the new record, <span class="song" about="ZombieGirl">‘Zombie Girl</span>,’ and
the refrain is ‘Emptiness / Tell me about your nature.’ That’s a real question. I want to understand—what is this feeling of
emptiness? Is that me? Am I just hollow and empty? Or is emptiness actually something beautiful?”</p>
<p>As we talked, Lenker teared up. I hadn’t yet had to idly watch someone cry from six feet away. As she wiped her cheeks, I
crammed my hands in my pockets and mumbled something about how the worst and saddest thing about heartbreak is that it
always ends.</p>
<p><span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> formed in <span class="place" about="Brooklyn" data-wikidata-id="Q18419" data-label="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span> in 2015, and quickly became one of the most acclaimed new bands of recent years, in part
because of Lenker’s emotional transparency, and in part because of how her voice, which is delicate and craggy, complements
the group’s bold use of dissonance and volume. In 2019, <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> was nominated for a <span class="award" about="GrammyAwardBestAlternative" data-label="Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album" data-wikidata-id="Q1542129"> Grammy Award for Best Alternative
Music Album</span>, but its work is more commonly described as <span class="genre" about="folk-rock">folk rock</span>, a characterization that, although accurate—the band is as
indebted to visionary singer-songwriters such as <span about="JudeeSill" data-label="Judee Sill" data-wikidata-id="Q271443"><a href"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/sill-love-songs">Judee Sill</a></span> and <span class="person" about="VashtiBunyan" data-label="Vashti Bunyan" data-wikidata-id="Q297486">Vashti Bunyan</span> as it is to <span class="person" about="SonicYouth" data-label="Sonic Youth" data-wikidata-id="Q2343791"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sonic-youth">Sonic Youth</a></span> and <span class="person" about="NeilYoung" data-label="Neil Young" data-wikidata-id="Q1754505"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-neil-young-time-capsule">Neil Young</a></span>—feels too
tame. <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span>’s best songs begin quietly, and expand until it seems as though a major artery were about to burst. The results can
be strange and thrilling. “<span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Adrianne</span> has that disorienting quality all real-deal types have, where she comes at her songs so sideways
that it subverts the form,” <span class="person" about="JeffTweedy" data-label="JeffTweedy" data-wikidata-id="Q1686370">Jeff Tweedy</span>, the front man for <span class="band" about="Wilco" data-label="Wilco" data-wikidata-id="Q637771"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/wilcos-music-for-adulthood">Wilco</a></span>, told me. “Sometimes you would swear it’s a mistake or
misunderstanding of her own song—‘Why’d she start singing there?’—but it’s not, it’s a precise angle that only she seems to
possess.”</p>

<p>The band grew out of a partnership between <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span>. They met at a show in  <span class="place" about="Boston" data-wikidata-id="Q100" data-label="Boston">Boston, where they had both been
undergraduates, and then ran into each other at a bodega on the day <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> moved to <span class="place" about="Brooklyn" data-wikidata-id="Q18419" data-label="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span>. “I was moving into a warehouse
in <span class="place" about="Bushwick" data-wikidata-id="Q2288728" data-label="Bushwick">Bushwick</span> with ten other artists,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> said. “I’m pretty sure it was illegal—there were beams separating the rooms, no
windows, a cement floor.” She and <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> soon began performing as a duo.</p>
<p>“When we first started playing, we would just sit together,” <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> told me. “She had these really wild fingerpicking patterns that
she had developed, and she would tune the guitar to so many different open tunings. I had this very syncopated, rhythmic
structure—hers was much more liquid. And, somehow, these different rhythmic landscapes created something.”</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> got a job as a back waiter at a restaurant on the <span class="place" about="UpperWestSide" data-wikidata-id="Q429687" data-label="Upper West Side">Upper West Side</span>. “Five days a week, at one in the morning, I was biking
all the way to <span class="place" about="Bushwick" data-wikidata-id="Q2288728" data-label="Bushwick">Bushwick</span> from <span about="SeventySecond">Seventy-second </span> and <span about="Columbus">Columbus</span>,” she recalled. “I was saving up for guitar amps, saving up for a
guitar, saving up for a van.”</p>
<p><span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> and <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> burned CDs of their music, wrapped them in paper bags, and wrote the track listings by hand. “<span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck</span>and I
played coffee shops and back-yard barbecues and dive bars and birthday parties and shows for nobody for a couple of years,”
<span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> said. In time, they fell in love, and, when she was twenty-four and <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> was twenty-eight, they got married.
There is footage of them busking in <span class="place" about="WashingtonSquarePark" data-wikidata-id="Q909592" data-label="Washington Square Park">Washington Square Park</span> in 2014, playing an early version of <span class="song" about="Paul">“Paul</span>,” which eventually
appeared on <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief<span>’s début album, “<span about="Masterpiece">Masterpiece</span>.” The audience—a middle-aged man in billowing khakis and sunglasses, a tall
guy talking on his cell phone—is gently uninterested in a <span class="place" about="NewYork" data-wikidata-id="Q1384" data-label="New York">New York </span> sort of way.  <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> share a microphone.
“Paul” is a song about having a hard time loving another person. “I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>
sings, her voice resigned. Yet the desire to be fixed—to find relief through love—remains. “I’ve been burning for you, baby, since
the moment I left,” she admits. The chorus is a mesmeric rush:</p>
<p class="quote">I’ll be your morning bright, good night, shadow machine</br>
I’ll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean</br>
I’ll be a real tough cookie with the whiskey breath</br>
I’ll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death</br></p>
<p>In the <span class="place" about="Catskills data-wikidata-id="Q20054657" data-label="Catskill Mountains">Catskills </span>, between recording sessions, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and her bandmates sometimes hiked into the woods to work on a tepeelike
structure they had taken to calling a fort. There was no trail, and getting to it required climbing up the face of a small
mountain, mostly by grabbing the trunks of saplings—a strategy any reasonable outdoorsperson would describe as inadvisable—
and scrambling to find holds in large rocks. One afternoon, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and I made our way there to sit on a boulder and talk. She
darted uphill gracefully.</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> was born in  <span class="place" about="Indianapolis" data-wikidata-id="Q6346" data-label="Indianapolis">Indianapolis in 1991, and brought up mostly in and around <span class="place" about="Minnesota" data-wikidata-id="Q1527" data-label="Minnesota">Minnesota </span>. She has a younger sister, Zoë, and a
younger brother, Noah. When <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> was five, she was hit on the head by a railroad spike that fell out of a tree house in her
family’s front yard. <span class="song" about="Mythological">“Mythological Beauty,”</span> a song from <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span>’s second record, <span class="song" about="Capacity">“Capacity,”</span> is addressed to her terrified mother:</p>
<img id="uccelli1"><!-- img id="block1"src="imgs/birds3.png" width="250" per hobby -->
<p class="quote">
Blood gushing from my head</br>
You held me in the back seat with a dishrag, soaking up blood with your eyes</br>

<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>’s parents married young, and joined a fringe religious sect before <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> was born. She remembers the group as having
“born-again-Christian, kind of cult vibes—a closed community. We lived in an apartment complex where the surrounding people
were part of the same thing. There were a lot of rules. Honestly, I remember there being a lot of shame. My sister’s name was evil,
because it wasn’t in the Bible. Certain shapes were evil, too, like the star. When we prayed, the Bible couldn’t touch the floor, and
we prayed under blankets.” Her mother recalled that sometimes the group provided a chaperon if the family travelled out of state.
(<span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>’s father disputes some of these details.)</p>
<p>Her parents left the sect when she was four, and for a short while they lived out of a van. “We were still quite religious until I was about eight or nine,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> said. “Then I watched my parents take a dramatic turn and discard all religion.” She found the shift
bewildering. “I just remember feeling, like, I’m not going to go along for this ride.” (Her father has since reconnected with his
faith, and describes his time away from it as hedonistic.)</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> has spent much of her adulthood trying to unpack the experience, and is now quick to recognize troubling rhythms from
her youth when they reëmerge in her adult relationships. “I sometimes equate intimacy with turbulence, which is familiar,” she
said. “The journey that I’m currently on is just: how do I transmute some of these patterns of violence?”</p>
<p>Her ideas of home are constantly changing. “I don’t really think of <span class="place" about="Minnesota" data-wikidata-id="Q1527" data-label="Minnesota">Minnesota </span> when I think of home,” she said. “I think of it as
part of who I am. The thing that I come back to is that it’s my loved ones, and Earth. I feel really at home here, in this spot in the
forest,” she said, looking around. “And it doesn’t feel like it’s anyone’s.”</p>
<p>Eventually, we climbed back down the mountain. <span class="person" about="SamOwens">Owens</span> and Cohen had built a stone dam in the stream that snakes across their
property, creating a little basin for swimming. The stream runs into the Esopus Creek, a sixty-five-mile tributary of the Hudson
River which winds through the eastern <span class="place" about="Catskill" data-wikidata-id="Q20054657" data-label="Catskill Mountains">Catskills </span> and fills the <span about="Ashokan">Ashokan Reservoir</span>. We walked barefoot over mossy bluestone. The
water was clear and bracing. Lenker disrobed and dunked, letting out an ecstatic yelp.</p>
<p>While <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and the rest of<span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> were working, they developed a habit of leaping into the water between takes. There’s
something curative about a frigid plunge, the way it forces the old air from your lungs. “You come out screaming,” Oleartchik said.
In 1702, Sir <span about="JohnFloyer">John Floyer</span>published a treatise on the benefits of cold bathing, a practice that was then still mostly unknown to the
English. “Cold baths act much on the Spirits, and preserve them from Evaporation, and render them Strong and Vigorous,” he
wrote. It’s comforting to think that, even in our bleakest moments, there might still be a way to protect our Spirits from
dissipating entirely.</p>
<p>As far back as <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> can remember, she has liked to sing. Her voice is soft but substantial, and contains an airy tremble that
sometimes resembles birdsong. On occasion, she lets it stretch and fracture. On “Not,” a deep and tumultuous song from
<span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span>’s fourth album, “<span about="TwoHands">Two Hands</span>,” Lenker sounds nearly feral: “Not the room / Not beginning / Not the crowd / Not
winning,” she grunts. When the band performs the song in concert, she might start to scream.</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> began playing guitar when she was six, and discovered an affinity for the instrument. Her father started giving her lessons.
“He’d be, like, Whoa—how do you already know that?” she said. “I was just eating it up.”</p>
<p>When <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> was thirteen, her parents divorced. She dropped out of school and moved in with her father in Minneapolis. He was
intent on managing—and, to a degree, monetizing—her nascent music career. “I think he wanted me to be famous, wanted me to
be the best, wanted me to win that shit,” she said. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> did not share his exact ambitions. She made some recordings but felt
disconnected from them. “The very first music I listened to, and then continued to listen to throughout that whole time, was by
<span class="person" about="PatMetheny" data-label="Pat Metheny" data-wikidata-id="Q213887">Pat Metheny</span> and <span class="person" about="MichaelHedges" data-label="Michael Hedges" data-wikidata-id="Q206802">Michael Hedges</span>—these guitar guys my dad loved,” she said. When she was fifteen, a boyfriend introduced her
to  <span class="person" about="ElliothSmith" data-label="ElliotSmith" data-wikidata-id="Q210428">Elliott Smith</span>, whose tense and immediate <span class="genre" about="folk">folk</span> songs provided a counterpoint to the more polished music her father had
encouraged. “I was, like, Oh, my God, this is so good,” she recalled. “This is all I want to do. I don’t want to create these elaborate,
pop-sounding productions.”</p>
<p>At sixteen, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> cut her hair short and briefly ran away from home. She got her G.E.D., and enrolled in a five-week summer
program at the Berklee College of Music, in <span class="place" about="Boston" data-wikidata-id="Q100" data-label="Boston">Boston</span>. Toward the end of the summer, she made an appointment with <span class="person" about="DamienBracken">Damien
Bracken</span>, the dean of admissions. “I went into his office and I said, ‘I don’t know any of this music theory, any of this stuff that is
on your curriculum, but can I play you a song?’ ” She performed an original piece called  <span class="song" about="FarfromWhereIStarted">“Far from Where I Started.”</span> With the
dean’s support, she applied for and received a full scholarship to Berklee, offered by the blues guitarist <span class="person" about="SusanTedeschi" data-label="Susan Tedeschi" data-wikidata-id="Q275625"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/an-o-k-day-in-harlem">Susan Tedeschi</a></span>. “I’ll never
forget the image of, like, twenty-five boys shredding on guitars in the hallway, preparing for their auditions and exams,” she said.
“I felt self-conscious that I didn’t know those things.” Lenker was still figuring out how to do ordinary chores, such as buying
laundry detergent. “I hadn’t gone to high school. I left <span class="place" about="Minnesota" data-wikidata-id="Q1527" data-label="Minnesota">Minnesota </span>, I left home, I was on my own,” she recalled. “I was seventeen.”</p>
<p>Despite the intensity of her training, virtuosity doesn’t resonate for <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> as much as vulnerability does; she has always been more
interested in making emotional connections. The pop singer <span class="person" about="CarlyRaeJepsen" data-label="Carly Rae Jepsen" data-wikidata-id="Q52583">Carly Rae Jepsen</span> told me that she has been able to find enormous
comfort in the way that <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> sings about her life. “I came across <span class="song" about="Paul">‘Paul’</span> while I was in  <span class="place" about="Italy" data-wikidata-id="Q38" data-label="Italy">Italy for a solo adventure trip,” <span class="person" about="CarlyRaeJepsen" data-label="Carly Rae Jepsen" data-wikidata-id="Q52583">Jepsen</span> said.
“The lyrics spoke to me like a journal entry would. She’s brilliantly confessional.”</p>
<p>In addition to the recordings that <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> made as a teen-ager, her work with <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span>, and the four records she has done with <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span>, she has also released two solo albums:  “<span class="album" about="HoursWeretheBirds">Hours Were the Birds</span>,” in 2014, and  “<span class="album" about="Abysskiss">Abysskiss</span>,” in 2018. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> is curious about
the mechanics of creative work—the spring from which songs appear—but finds that the process itself is more visceral and
perceptive. “How does a song come into being at all? How does it form and organize itself into the pattern?” she said. “I never
think, Oh, I want to make something that sounds like this. It’s just reaching for elements. I see the visual of translucent ribbons
flowing in a riverlike way—they’re multicolored. And maybe there’s one specific color that I want to braid in, and they’re all
flowing by, and maybe it’ll go by for a while with nothing of that color, and then, ‘Ah, there.’ ”</p>
<p>When I asked <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> to describe <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>’s songwriting, he paused for forty-five seconds to gather his thoughts. “It’s as if she
removes her conscious mind from the room,” he said finally. “She’ll hold her guitar, and she’ll start to speak in abstractions, or
speak in complete nonsense—just sounds and shapes. Then she emerges from that space, and slowly the words start to form into
syllables, and into the English language, and become a story, or a character, or a reflection of her own experience. But it has this
really clear element of . . .” He thought about it. “Grace.”</p>
<p>One evening in early September, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and I sat on opposite sides of <span class="person" about="SamOwens">Owens</span> and Cohen’s kitchen table, snacking on figs
and cheese. It was raining, and Lenker lit some candles. Her sister, Zoë, who was visiting for the week, was reading in a
bedroom upstairs. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> showed me the room where she was staying, and the notebook where she had written most of the lyrics
for “Songs.” There was a watercolor of a small cabin and a yellow sky propped up against a mirror, and a photograph of her
grandmother by her bedside. Recently, she had acquired an electric pencil sharpener, which she demonstrated: “Isn’t that
satisfying?” She picked up the acoustic Martin guitar she plays on the new albums. “I’ve had this since I was fourteen,” she said,
strumming a chord.</p>
<p><span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> was on tour in Europe when <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus">covid-19</a> cases began to spike there. Minutes before the band was to take the stage in
<span about="Cph">Copenhagen</span>, the Danish government announced a ban on gatherings of more than a hundred people. The venue was already full.
“We went out in the street and played some acoustic stuff, just four or five songs. Then we all had to make a snap decision about
where we were going,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> said.</p>
<p>“Suddenly, we’re all in this lobby of this hotel that’s basically empty, and the dude at reception is wearing black gloves, and there’s
no more music,” Oleartchik recalled wistfully.</p>
<p>Lenker flew back to <span class="place" about="NewYork" data-wikidata-id="Q1384" data-label="New York">New York </span> and then headed north, to a cabin in the foothills of the <span about="Berkshires">Berkshires</span>, in western <span about="Massachussetts">Massachusetts</span>.
She was entranced by the sound of the space, which she described as “like the inside of an acoustic guitar.” She asked <span about="Weinrobe">Philip
Weinrobe</span>, an engineer and the owner of Rivington 66, a recording studio on the <span about="LowerEastSide">Lower East Side</span>, to help her make an album
there. He agreed, and Lenker headed back to the city. “She left at, like, 5 a.m. to come pick me up in <span class="place" about="Brooklyn" data-wikidata-id="Q18419" data-label="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span>,” <span about="Weinrobe">Weinrobe</span>
recalled. “The whole thing was structured around the space, which was very small, with exposed wooden beams. We could hear the
bugs, we could hear the wind in the trees. The idea was to really lean super hard into that physical atmosphere, and to create a
record that tried to mimic it. As soon as I got there, everything started to shift: my sense of time, my sense of self, the way I
breathed the air.” He added, “There’s no plumbing in the cabin. You poop in a bucket.”</p>
<p>They used a binaural microphone to capture the sound of the room. “You really feel like you’re sitting in front of Adrianne
singing,”<span about="Weinrobe">Weinrobe</span>  said. “You can hear the birds go by, and you hear the squeak of the fingerboard, and the sound bouncing off the
walls.”</p>
<p>Lenker’s lyrics often allude to nature, and she toggles between straightforward narratives and more imagistic lines. Her language
reminds me, at times, of <span about="JoannaNewsom"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/precious-mettle">Joanna Newsom</a></span> or <span about="Louise">Louise Erdrich</span>—it’s mystical yet highly grounded in the physical world. On
“>span about="Ingydar">Ingydar</span>,” a new track, she sings:</p>

<p class="quote" id="uccelli">

From books half read</br>
The juice of dark cherries cover his chin</br>
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his</br>
Jaw like lead

<p>Weinrobe’s grandmother died while they were recording, which meant that he and Lenker were both suffering a loss. “I wrote nine
of those songs once we started the session,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>said. “We would record them the same day that I wrote them. I was surprised
at how much I was writing, because I was in so much pain. I was not in the part of the pain where I was just reflecting on it.” She
added, “I feel as if my psyche was putting as many things together as I could from my relationship, as many beautiful things as I
could, to preserve it into eternity.” One of the instrumental pieces, “<span about="MusicforIndigo">Music for Indigo</span>,” was originally written as a kind of offering
—something for her former partner to listen to as she fell asleep at night.<p>
<p>Two years ago, in <span class="place" about="California" data-wikidata-id="Q99" data-label="California">California</span>, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> bought a used Toyota Land Cruiser with a multitone paint job and a manual
transmission. She drove it back East and began fixing it up, sanding down the exterior and refinishing it in a bright, hopeful
blue. (The first time I met Lenker, she was in the midst of expertly backing the truck down a winding driveway and across a
narrow wood-plank bridge.) With some help from an uncle, she outfitted the back of the truck with a foldable sleeping pad, a
cooler, and wooden drawers for tools, clothes, and supplies. It has enormous tires—“It can go up any kind of mountain road,” she
said proudly—and a beaded medallion hanging from the rearview mirror. It would pull her trailer across the country.</p>
<p><span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> and <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> divorced in 2018. They are now what Lenker describes as “deep friends.” They didn’t hide their marriage and its
dissolution from the press, exactly, but they also didn’t speak about it publicly. “I feel like it made us stronger and closer,” Lenker
said, of the breakup. “I feel like we sing together better now, and we write together more. A lot of our love is funnelled into the
music, which is maybe the form it was always meant to have.”</p>
<p>Krivchenia joined the band shortly after <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> and Lenker got engaged. “I was suddenly plopped into observing the intimacy, the
beauty, and the shortcomings of a relationship, 24/7,” he said. “It’s been amazing to see it evolve.” He added, “They broke up, and
it was a whole huge year of a specific kind of stress for them, and for the band. We did some tours without Buck, when they just
needed to not be together for a while.” Though less dramatic fissures have undone other bands, playing together seemed only to
accelerate the healing process. “<span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Adrianne</span> is always writing about whatever’s going on in her life, and so when they were getting
divorced she was writing about it,” Krivchenia said. “<span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck</span> was processing that in real time, onstage. Some nights I’d look over and
be, like, ‘Oof, that’s a rough one to hear, man.’ But he was really supportive of it.”</p>
<p>After their separation, <span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> moved to <span class="place" about="California" data-wikidata-id="Q99" data-label="California">California</span> and wrote a record, “Two Saviors,” which he will release in January. It’s got more
twang and air than <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span>’s albums—<span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> is from Texas, and his solo work is infused with the pathos and mischief of <span about="Townes">Townes
Van Zandt</span> and <span about="Waylon">Waylon Jennings</span>. “I played a huge amount of shows on my own, learned to surf. And she did her own thing,” he
said. “When we finally did come back together, we jumped right into a tour. The music felt more important than us. It felt like
something we had to serve and set aside our fears for.”</p>
<p>><span class="person" about="BuckMeek"> Buck Meek</span> had been visiting his partner in the Netherlands, where the government had lifted coronavirus travel restrictions for people
in committed relationships. A couple of weeks after we first spoke, he sent me a voice memo. “I think we sacrificed it all for the
music,” he said, of his marriage to <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span>. “It was a vessel for our love and friendship. And then our love and friendship became a
vessel for the music.” It was too hard, in the end, to nurture a new marriage and also be in a band. “We didn’t actually have a home
for maybe four or five years,” he said. “There was no privacy whatsoever, because we were always on tour. There was a complete
lack of personal time or space. And part of us knew this—we were aware that it was taking a toll on our relationship.”</p>
<p>In conversation, I found <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> attentive and kind, and there were moments during our time together when the emotional
maturity of the <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> universe—how patient and evolved the intra-band negotiations are; how careful the members are to
preëmptively diffuse volatile situations; how they have even adopted the phrase “everything is optional” to avoid compromising
their integrity—felt almost intimidating. Anyone who has survived an experience via the careful suppression or
compartmentalization of emotion is likely to find <span class="band" about="BigThief" data-label="Big Thief" data-wikidata-id="Q28228836">Big Thief</span> ’s system of communication astounding. “If you don’t talk, you know,
you’re gonna get to <span about="Kansas">Kansas</span> and you’re still gonna have feelings from <span about="Baltimore">Baltimore</span>,” Oleartchik told me. The end result of all that
talking, he said, was the sentimental (yet still radical) discovery that “it’s actually acceptable to be who you are to your friends.”</p>
<p><span class="person" about="Kyle">Kyle Jaster</span> and <span class="person" about="Handschumacher"> Misha Handschumacher</span>live down the road from the studio, on Atticus Farm, where they grow flowers and
organic vegetables, and tend to a passel of free-range heritage pigs. They offered to let Lenker park her trailer in their
driveway while she worked on it, and before long they became part of the renovation team. When I arrived there one afternoon,
<span class="person" about="Kyle">Jaster</span>’s brother, Wyatt, was measuring and installing new plywood subfloors. The trailer was small, aluminum, and from 1966.
The interior was painted cherry red, but <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> had just picked out a new color, a mellow cream called Honeyed White. We
began priming and repainting the cabinets, drawers, and trim. “I’m curious how this trip is going to feel,” <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> said. “I’m excited
about the freedom, but I haven’t really felt full of relief. I’ve found it almost burdensome: I don’t know where home is. I don’t know
who I belong with.”</p>
<p>When it grew too dark to paint, we retreated to a fire pit in the back yard. <span class="person" about="Kyle">Jaster </span>and <span about="Handschumacher">Handschumacher </span>prepared supper—okra and
carrots grilled over the fire, chicken legs, blackberries, homemade ice cream—as their two dogs sprinted in figure eights around our
lawn chairs. At dusk, a large owl swooped along the tree line. <span class="person" about="SamOwens">Owens</span> and Cohen came by with beer. At some point, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> ended
up with a Cuban cigar. “This was my fantasy when I was a kid,” she said, taking a tentative puff and laughing. “I wore knee-length
jean shorts, plaid shirts, and a backward baseball cap, and all I wanted to do was eat beef jerky, drive a tractor, and smoke cigars.”
An outdoor speaker played <span class="person" about="MichaelHurley" data-label="Michael Hurley" data-wikidata-id="Q5817598">Michael Hurley</span>, <span class="person" about="ArthurRussell" data-label="Arthur Russell" data-wikidata-id="Q670277">Arthur Russell</span>, <span class="person" about="Moondog" data-label="Moondog" data-wikidata-id="Q134864">Moondog</span>, <span class="person" about="LucindaWilliams" data-label="Lucinda Williams" data-wikidata-id="Q256813">Lucinda Williams</span>, <span class="person" about="BillCallahan" data-label="Bill Callahan" data-wikidata-id="Q862005">Bill Callahan</span>. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> talked about
moving to <span about="Vermont">Vermont</span> this fall—maybe building a little cabin in a corner of some land that her sister was buying there.</p>
<p>I left shortly after midnight. On the drive home, I rolled the windows down and let my hair blow around. I played “<span about="DragoneEyes">Dragon Eyes</span>,”
the penultimate track on “Songs.” It’s musically spare, with acoustic guitar and just a bit of brushed percussion. The final verse
implores:</p>
<p class="quote">Stars bloom
On a warm summer night</br>
They have a clear view</br>
Without the bedroom light</br>
I just want a place with you</br>
I just want a place</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I returned to the farm to toast the renovation of the trailer. It was a brisk mid-September evening, and leaves
were starting to accumulate in corners. <span class="person" about="Kyle">Jaster</span>and <span class="person" about="Handschumacher">Handschumacher</span> set out platters of gumbo, corn bread, and succotash on a long
picnic table in the back yard. We kept our coats on as we ate. After supper, <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> stood in the door of the trailer, holding up a
glass of bourbon, and offered sincere thanks to everyone who had helped her fix it up. The interior was complete—new hardwood
floors, linen curtains hung on silver wire, a small dining table made from a maple tree on the farm. <span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> showed me the blue
enamel coffee mug she’d placed in the cupboard (“Unbreakable!”), the books she’d lined up on a small shelf near her bed, the single
cast-iron casserole dish she could use to cook in the woodstove. She still needed to buy a tire jack and some roadside flares, just in
case. She was leaving in two days.<p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/precious-mettle">“Letters on Cézanne,”</a> <span about="Rilke">Rilke</span> describes autumn as “containing depth within itself, darkness, something of the grave almost.”
<span class="person" about="AdrianneLenker" data-label="Adrianne Lenker" data-wikidata-id="Q64875564">Lenker</span> writes often about time and loss—how to cling to what we need and let go of everything else. For her, songwriting is a way
of externalizing specific experiences or memories and pinning them in place, like a butterfly under glass. “I like my songs to be
reminders of certain things that I don’t want to forget,” she told me. Once they’re captured, then in a sense she is free. ♦ </p>

<div class="ArtBody" id="third_article">
<p id="lo3"><span id="drop">In</span> the spring of 2018, a <span class="key" about="red">red</span> mist descended on <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467"><a href="https://diymag.com/artist/anna-calvi">Anna Calvi</a></span>. A ruddy flush suffused her <span class="??" about="Instagram">Instagram</span>, tinting lusty pictures of surrealist beauties, a closeup of smeared lips, a naked back painted with French words: “mute and blind here I am, dressed in thoughts that you lend me”. It was the first bloodshot glimpse into the world of her third album ‘<span class="album" about="Hunter">Hunter</span>’, a record the colour of flesh, lust, danger, alarm, life.</p>

<p>In June, <span class="place" about="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84" data-label="London">London</span>  got its first live taste in a wild show at <span class="place" about="Heaven" >Heaven</span>, during which <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span> dropped to her knees, wailing with both <span class="key" about="guitar">guitar</span> and voice like never before, in the middle of a runway projecting into the crowd.</p>

<p>“The record is very much about contrasts,” says <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>, who has graciously agreed to give up her Friday night to talk on the phone about the album. “About once being very powerful and strong, but then also [having] moments of real intimacy and vulnerability… I wanted to get the extremes of contrast even more onstage. When I’m there on my knees screaming, it’s incredibly exposing for people to witness me completely and utterly unleash my whole sense of my body, but at the same time it’s very confrontational and powerful. I feel like the stakes are high for both me and the audience.”</p>

    <p>‘<span class="album" about="Hunter">Hunter</span>’, an album that lives on the tips of its nerves, is full of high stakes. Where once <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>’s presence glistened with hauteur, now it is red-raw, grabbing you as forcefully as the dancers clasp at her face and throat in the erotic, unsettling video for lead single ‘<span class="song" about="DontBeattheGirloutofmyboy">Don’t Beat the Girl Out of My Boy</span>’. The song, says <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>, reflects on how soon children are restricted by gender (“when I was a child, I felt like I was a little boy and I hated being put in anything remotely female”) but also on “the defiance of happiness”.</p>

<p>“I wanted to show that me and this person were very happy together,” she explains, “and if somebody else outside of our pure bubble of love tries to disrupt it I am wholeheartedly ready to defend it with my life. That’s what the screaming’s about. It’s like: don’t you dare try and ruin this pure, beautiful moment.”</p>

    <p><span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>’s two previous albums had expressed her sexuality in songs such as ‘<span about="Eliza">Eliza</span>’ and ‘<span about="SuzanneandI">Suzanne and I</span>’, or her sense of gender in ‘<span about="Illbeyourman">I’ll Be Your Man</span>’, but it’s a subject she’s not addressed head-on until now.</p>

<p>“I think that when my first record came out and there were quite a few songs about women on it,” she muses. “I almost didn't notice that they were about women because it was just normal for me. I felt slightly exposed, I think. And I was worried because I saw how <span about="BethDitto">Beth Ditto</span> got treated in the early 2000s being openly gay... It would be like an article began, “<span about="BethDitto">Beth Ditto</span>, lesbian" and I thought that was so ridiculous, to define her by just calling her that and not calling her a musician.”</p>

<p><span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>, though, wasn’t singled out in the same way. “It felt that people were just listening to my music and those that needed to hear the <span class="key" about="queerness">queernes</span>, they heard it, and those that didn't need it for whatever reason they didn't notice it.</p> <p class="quote">I don’t feel restricted - I don’t think I ever did - but I think I feel more defiant now.”</p>

<p><span class="album" about="Hunter">‘Hunter’</span> steps boldly into the current open discussion around gender and sexuality. Its title reflects a woman taking on a traditionally male position of strength and active pursuit. “I imagined the teenage me, what kind of representation of a woman would have actually been helpful, especially as a <span class="key" about="queerness">queer</span> teenager,” says <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>. “This idea of a woman being a hunter and going out into the world and seeing it as hers, being the protagonist of her own story, and just searching for pleasure in whatever ways that she wants, without any sense of shame, felt quite an important thing for me. I'd broken up with someone after eight years and I was now with someone new, living in <span class="place" about="France" data-wikidata-id="Q84" data-label="France">France</span>, and I guess I was sort of enjoying having to start over again and find out what I wanted from my life.”</p>

<p>Songs such as ‘<span about="Asaman">As A Man</span>’ and ‘<span about="Alpha">Alpha</span>’ play luxuriously with sex, <span class="key" about="gender">gender, power and language. “We assume when we hear the word ‘alpha’ that we're talking about a man,” says <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>. “The way we use words affects our sense of self. And I just felt that it was important that it isn't gender-specific, this trait. A lot of the strongest people I know are women, because they have to be.”</p>

<p>The way the words are delivered, too, is a revelation – <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>’s voice ranges from banshee scream via seductive falsetto to hot-and-heavy half-spoken. “I've always been kind of interested in the lower tones of my voice in the past,” she says, “but I wanted this record to be more visceral and more wild, less controlled, and exploring a higher register while still singing really loud felt like a really good way of exploring those emotions. When you sing that loud and that high, it takes all of your body to be able to do it, there's literally no space to have any other thought or any other emotion than the one that you're trying to express. It's a very honest way of singing in that I found it to be very in tune with the kind of record I wanted to make.”
That <span class="key" about="record">record was a long time in the coming; her last album, ‘One Breath’, was released in 2013. But <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>, waiting until she had something she really wanted to say, wasn’t idle in the meantime, collaborating with <span class="person" about="Mariannefaithfull">Marianne Faithfull</span> on the track ‘<span about="FallingBack">Falling Back</span>’, <span class="person" about="DavidByrne">David Byrne</span> on the <span class="album" about="StrangeWeather">Strange Weather</span> covers EP and the Heritage Orchestra in a series of live performances. Last year, she wrote the music for her first opera, The Sandman, based on the ETA Hoffmann story of lust and monsters and madness, directed by experimental theatre director <span class="person" about="RobertWilson">Robert Wilson</span>. </p>

<p>“It was a very high-stress situation,” she explains. “He was improvising the whole thing, and he would just go "play something" and I would just have to improvise pieces right there and then in front of 30 people. I was inspired by how high his stakes are… this idea of really taking risks and being on the edge I think I learnt from him, and I definitely tried to have some of that making the record.”</p>

<p>Joined by new producer <span class="person" about="NickLaunay">Nick Launay</span>, with her longtime band of multi-instrumentalist <span class="person" about="MallyHarpaz">Mally Harpaz</span> and drummer <span class="person" about="AlexThomas">Alex Thomas</span> abetted by <span class="band" about="BadSeeds">Bad Seeds</span> bassist <span about="MartynPCasey">Martyn P Casey</span> and <span class="band" about="Portishead">Portishead</span>’s <span class="person" about="AdrianUtley">Adrian Utley</span> on keys, she spent late nights in the studio chasing the right feeling. “I didn't ask myself too many questions other than: what does this music make me feel. I didn't want it to feel like a cerebral record, it's meant to be emotional, and of the body.”</p>

<p><span class="album" about="Hunter">‘Hunter’</span>’s bodily, emotive shock is a vital, beautiful addition to the ever-growing canon of records boldly and openly exploring queer identity; <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span> herself has been inspired by <span about="Christine">Christine and the Queens</span>, <span about="PerfumeGenius">Perfume Genius</span> and <span about="Ezra">Ezra Furman</span>. “It feels like an exciting time in that people are asking questions like 'Is this really all there is?' and 'Can't things be better?',” she asserts. “And I think that's really important and I hope that it causes lasting change.”</p>

<p>We’re not living in utopia yet; and <span class="album" about="Hunter">‘Hunter’</span>’s most striking track, the extraordinary, churning, tropical fever that is ‘Indies or Paradise’, finds Calvi “down on my knees, crawling through the trees like an animal”, still hunting for happiness, for freedom. “That song is about how people are eternally optimistic,” says <span class="person" about="AnnaCalvi" data-label="Anna Calvi" data-wikidata-id="Q262467">Calvi</span>. “The idea that love can somehow save you from the shit. We all trudge through the mud and dirt of our lives, with this idea that if only we could meet someone that we would somehow get away from the bad stuff…. It feels religious, somehow, this belief in love. I find it both tragic and really beautiful.”</p>

   <p> <span class="album" about="Hunter">‘Hunter’</span> is out 31st August via <span class="label" about="Domino">Domino</span>.</p>
