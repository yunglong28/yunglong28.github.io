      Following the project’s guidelines, this page is dedicated to documenting properly the development of our styles according to their historical inspiration. In this section, we will spend some words on the general process behind the development of RESONANCE.
      The structure of the three issues and their articles reflects a hierarchical form, composed of nested HTML elements, tags, and attributes. Collective classes and individual ids were added to help in the stylistic process of the different elements.
      Furthermore, we also semantically marked up the article, in order to create a filtering feature for highlighting meaningful elements in the different articles. For this purpose, the following categories were individuated across the issues:
<i>People, Places, Musicians, Newspapers, Streaming Services, Organizations, Websites, Events, Music genres, Album, Songs</i> & <i>Concepts</i>.

              <p class="titles style_title">ILLUMINISM</p>
                 <p class="style">Books played a decisive role in the Enlightenment, elevating European citizens’ consciousness and political awareness to new levels. Thanks to new a greater alphabetization, new discussion places (like cafes), and new techniques, the 1700s saw a greater spreading of printing culture all over Europe but also in America and the East.</p>
                 <P class="titles fonts_title">FONTS</p>
                <p class="fonts">Regarding fonts, the Enlightenment period saw a rise in typography with a bigger stroke contrast, stylized shapes with bracketed serifs, and round, bulbous terminals, fitting the Rational spirit of the era. Yet, also a revolutionary and radical aspect was involved, as these fonts are the first to break up with the classical handwritten tradition and to embrace progressively automatic typing: for this reason, they are called Transisionist (the most famous being the font Romains du Roi). The transition led to the most important trend in the period (particularly, from the second half of the century): the Neoclassical style, inspired by the geometric rationale of the Ancient World and expressed in fonts like Didot. The Didot family were among the first to set up a printing press in the newly independent Greece, which was also a great example of a struggle for national reasons for patriots all over Europe.
                <br>
                <img src="imgs/Didot_Doc_1.jpg" class="imgs_docs">
                    The typeface is based on a collection of related types developed from 1784–1811 by Firmin Didot. Firmin cut the letters and cast them as type in Paris, and his older brother Pierre used them in printing. Firmin was also the inventor of stereotypography, an innovation in the printing process that completely changed the book industry, allowing books to be printed less expensively. This opened book ownership and casual literacy up to the common person. We will consider the Didot style as the representative of the Enlightenment and thus build our style using Didot’s books as the main inspiration. Thus, we adopted two variants of Didot for our style: GSF Didot was used for the text body while Lynotype Didot Roman for titles and headings.
                </p>
                 <P class="titles layout_title">LAYOUT</p>
                <p class="layout">
                    Didot’s books were organized according to the typical choices of the Neoclassical spirit: minimal decoration, wide margins, and linear borders characterize their books.
                    The style adopted for the front page is the one we used for different elements in the articles:
                    <ul>
                   <li>The title is a Didot font, specifically called GFS Didot, all in caps with a semi-bold trait. The margins are wide and the letter spacing is evident so to organize them more vertically the content.</li>
                    <li>The subtitle is separated from the title by a small hr element. It is again in Didot style but a different font called Linotype Didot Roman. and all in caps but without the bold effect. Margins, letter spaces, and line-height are wide to give the content a more vertical structure like in Didot’s books.</li>
                    <li>The Didot Logo separates subtitles from the authors and publication date, which are a smaller version of the subtitle (20px instead of 30px).</li>


                </ul>


                        <img src="imgs/didot3.jpg" class="imgs_docs">


                <ul>
               <li>The paragraph title is again in all caps, with wide letter spacing and a small hr element above separating from the body. This takes it back from the title style, which is GSF Didot with boldness.</li>
                <li>The first letter of the body of the text is bigger and bolder compared to the rest.</li>
                <li>The body is GFS Didot with a 40px margin and 2px letter spacing to reproduce the elegant and spacious style of Neoclassical typography.</li>

              <p class="titles style_title">HOBBY HORSE</p>
                 <p class="style"><p><i>The Hobby Horse</i> was a quarterly Victorian periodical in England published by the Century Guild of Artists  from 1884 to 1892. The magazine was titled The Century Guild Hobby Horse during its publication from 1884–1892, but in its final years in 1893 and 1894 it was simply The Hobby Horse. </p>
<p>The Century Guild was a group of craftsmen whose primary fields of expertise included architecture, stained glass work, and design. They were fiercely committed to exclusivity as opposed to expansion, to the cult of handcraftsmanship in protest to mass production and mechanical industry.</p>
<p>From its opening number (1884) the work was printed at the Chiswick Press and included various articles not only on arts and design but other subjects including literature and social issues as well. It also featured artwork such as sketches, plates, photographs, engravings, wood cuts illustrations, lithographs and reproduced paintings.</p>
<p>Famous for the  tactile, material qualities of the publication.  The CGHH was, as Frost puts it, “an entirely new style of magazine, in format and general presentation; even today the appearance, the feel, the whole style of the issue seems remarkable”<a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>

                 <p class="fonts"><p>The Century Guild intended typography as an art form as well. An example of a typeface in the journal was <i>Caslon old-face</i>. Thus, we adopted two variants of Caslon old face, the regular one for the body of the text and the title of the issue (which we rendered in capital letters) and the italic one for the subtitles. To make the text as similar as possible to the original source the weight of both fonts was set to bold in order to give the text more thickness. </p>
<p>For the hand lettered parts that sometimes can be found among the periodical pages we opted for <i>P22 Operina Fiore Fiore</i> font which seemed to us pretty similar to the original handwritten text.</p>

<p>The magazine which drew many of their ideas from the growing Arts & Crafts Movement, the Pre-Raphaelites, the Decadent movement and the new Aestheticism and disseminates values of Art Nouveau, features reproductions of artworks, decorations and illustrations that we decided to place at the end of each columns. </p>
<p>In fact, we treated each colums of the issue as the pages of the Victorian periodicals using wide space around small blocks of text in order to achieve a striking effect. Moreover, the first paragraph of each column begins with a drop cap that we extracted from the original text.</p>

                 <p>Belle époque: champagne, cabarets, cafes, cinemas, can-can and sparkling lights. A name coined to evoke the frail wonders industrial age was promising to Europe: carefreeness, luxury, leisure.</p>
                 <p>Along with wealth, innovations gave rise to mass production and consumption: new products crowded the shelves of department stores and filled the visitors of great exhibitions with amazement.</p>
                  <p>Art stroke a deal with the productive sector and modern advertising was born.
                  The complicity between artists and industry led to the creation works that are nowadays celebrated as masterpieces, such as the posters by Toulouse Lautrec or Alfons Mucha.
                  The very first communication campaigns often took the form of affiches, i.e. manifestos hanging on in the city walls. Along with material goods, the would often promote the products of the newly born entertainment industry: shows such as the circus, the opera, ballets and cafés chantants that livened up the bourgeois’ spare time.</p>
                  </p>
                 <p class="titles titles fonts_title">REFERENCES</p>
                 <p>As a reference for our websites, we chose three advertising manifestos by two masters of these times: Jules Chéret and Leonardo Cappiello.

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Ch%C3%A9ret">Jules Chéret</a> (1836 –1932) — a French painter and lithographer — is considered the father of the modern manifesto.
                He revolutionised contemporary poster art by bringing images — rather than texts — to the foreground.
                Indeed, since manifestos were generally posted on the city walls and passers-by would only cast a quick glance on them, it was crucial for advertising posters to prove impressive at first sight.
                In addition, the centrality of images rather implied that that advertising posters could be enjoyed and understood by illiterate people (a considerable part of the population).
                Chéret’s success inspired a new generation of designers and artists including, among others, Toulouse-Lautrec and Leonetto Cappiello.</p>

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonetto_Cappiello">Leonetto Cappiello</a>(1875-1942) was an Italian poster art designer and painter who mainly lived and worked in Paris. He is often referred to as the father of modern advertising, as he was an absolute innovator in advertising poster design.
                After having his debut in Paris in the wake of Chéret, with the affiche Chocolat Klaus (1903), Cappiello defines his style and revolutionizes the canons of advertising graphics.
                From 1903 on, in fact, his works will feature characters and images that don’t hold a direct relation with the product to be advertised but are rather conceived to create a highly recognizable brand image. In addition — in order to make the advertising image memorable and to attain communicative effectiveness — Cappiello abandons his initial decorative tendencies to embrace a more direct style, based on solid backgrounds, timbral colors, chromatic synthesis and foreground figures centered in space.
                The main objective is to amaze by the public, to be remembered: the modern Italian advertising poster is born.</p>


                 </p>
                 <p class=" titles layout_title">LAYOUT</p>
                 <p>Following the reference works, the three columns feature a regular composition: the image is central and framed by the text, which usually lies above or below it, separate or overlapping.
                Images transmit a sense of movement, while texts are usually impactful but pretty static, essential.
                Each of the three column presents thin, regular borders: they represent the edges of paper or canvas supports on which posters would to be fixed.</p>

              <p class=" titles fonts_title">FONTS</p>
                <p>All fonts have been selected to result as similar to the reference text as possible.
                Since advertising manifestos would be on the streets, texts are usually characterised by big dimensions and capital letters.
                The following fonts have been selected:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Jules Chéret, Folies bergere, Les Girard (1877): the text is written in a slightly irregular fashion, with jagged margins; the title is bolder than the subtitle.
                The chosen font is Benjamin Franklin, named after the famous American written, statesman and type designer, which offered us a similar, slightly irregular effect.</li>
                <li>Jules Chéret, Palais de Glace (1894): the poster features a rounded, handwritten-style uppercase text.
                To reproduce it, we chose Golddrew, with its rounded, soft shapes.</li>
                <li>Leonetto Cappiello, Chocolat Klaus (1903): the poster's headline is in a condensed stick font, the with balanced and modern lettering.
                We opted for Bebas Neue: this font, often used in brand logos and posters, is characterised by lean lines, elegant shapes, straightforwardness which recall the essentiality and impactivity.</li>
                </ol>


                 <P class="titles colors_title">COLORS</p>
                 <p>Colour, of course, played a crucial role in attracting costumers’ curiosity and attention.</p>

                 <p> Chéret is known for his use of chromolithography, a method to obtained multi-coloured prints through lithography. Indeed, he took this technique from the experimental level to that of a real art form. Chéret, in fact, did not simply create colored versions of the classic black and white lithographs, but was the first to bend the process for the purposes of pictorial rendering.</p>

                 <p>The extracted colours for his two posters are the following:</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Palais de Glace (1894): an off-white, old-paper texture and #003566 for the text;</li>
                  <li>Folies bergere, Les Girard (1877):  #F0603B for the background and #E4D9C5 for the text;</li>
                 </ul>

                  <p>As we mentioned, with Chocolate Klaus, Cappiello inaugurates his own style, based on solid backgrounds, timbral colors, chromatic synthesis: this means that he makes use of use of striking colors, with minimal gradations and nuances, often in sharp contrast with each other.</p>
                  <p>The extracted colours are the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Chocolat Klaus, (1903): #000000 for the background; #BFA404 for the header, #2F54A1 for the little banner below.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our final palette; from left to right: Palais de Glace's, Folies Bergere's and Chocolate Klaus' colours:</p>

                 <p class="style">
                   <p>ANALOG  is the style chosen for the 1980s theme. It aims to reproduce the typical features of the A.N.A.L.O.G Computing magazine (acronym for Atari Newsletter And Lots Of Games). ANALOG was the first magazine dedicated to the Atari 8-bit personal computer, which was a top selling computer in the U.S. during the early ’80s. Soon after the first issue rolled out in 1981, ANALOG quickly became one of the largest personal computer magazines in the 80’s. </p>
  <p>Co-founded by Lee H. Pappas and Michael DesChesnes it was published until 1989 featuring tutorials, product reviews, type-in software and machine language games that were accompanied by the assembly language source code. </p>

                 <p class="fonts">The fonts used are the following:
                  <ul>
            <li><i>Zapf Elliptical 71 regular</i> and <i>Joystick monospace</i> for the content of the articles. Zapf Elliptical 71 regular is a font characterized by a robust character and objective and classic forms while Joystix is a pixel-style typeface inspired by arcade video games of the 1980's. The versatility and legibility of the Zapf Elliptical 71 make it perfect for the representation of the text of the paragraphs. On the contrary, the Joystick monospace was chosen to display lines of code or to reproduce pixelated text on screen. </li>
                  <li><i>Harry Fat</i> for the issue’s titles that are often accompanied with colourful illustrations.</li>
                  <li><i>Para Aminobenzoic</i> font for the navbar. It’s a groovy, sci-fi, retro font which, even though not completely equal to the reference, was the most suited for reproducing the bold, coloured eye-catching logo in the cover of the magazine.</li>

                <p>Red top tabloids are named after their distinguishing red mastheads.
                  Their style of writing known as tabloid journalism: it «emphasizes features such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news. Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their sexual practices, misuse of narcotics, and the private aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of defamation.»
                  Red tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar and their layout usually gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word.
                  Examples of British red top newspapers include The Sun, the Daily Star and the Daily Mirror. Although not using red mastheads, the Daily Mail and Daily Express also use the 'tabloid journalism' model.

                  The Sun’s colour palette is mainly made up of three colours: black, white and a peculiar nuance of red (#B7403B). The three contrast with each other, create a bright and impacting effect and make texts stand out on the crowded page, packed with headings and images.

                    It’s 2035 and we’re losing. Humanity has lost New Dehli, Miami, and Venice: entire areas are devasted by severe floodings. Global warming is everyday life and it’s worse than we’ve considered it. After the initial shock, we started to adapt quickly in every field of life. Our beloved Web, which we loved in the innocent ‘90s and hated in the stupid ‘10s, is under trial: in a war economy, you cannot lose any kind of resources and, too many servers are filled with useless pages and flashy websites consuming important energy. Since we can’t simply shut down the web, we now have rationalized its usage, and web design is part of this process.
                    Thus, the founding work of some projects like LowTechMagazine or Organicbasis is the standard by today: websites are image-free (if not necessary or requested), they are often downloadable or printable on recycled paper to be read offline, and they compress all data to the greatest extent possible and load only the most crucial programming scripts, frameworks, and cookies. Plus, most of the servers rely on renewable energy. Big images, complex graphics, video streaming, and multiple fonts are memories of the past, glories of simpler times.

                 <p class="fonts">Regarding the fonts, the best choice from a sustainable point of view is to use default fonts, thus we adopted the classic Times New Roman. Why is it so? With the @font-face rule and Webfont distributors, it's straightforward to embed a typeface within a website. But they come at a cost: custom fonts impact performance, often adding several seconds of load time to a page. This design leverages these defaults, as it does not declare a font-family at all. This not only avoids having to load more assets but also reiterates the role of the browser in website access. Moreover, only one weight (regular) of a font is used, demonstrating that a typographic hierarchy can be established without loading multiple typefaces and weights. Basic colors were added to enhance the aesthetic, in this way:
                     <ul>
                <li>Titles are red, 44px</li>
                <li>Subtitles are darkgreengreen, 22px</li>
                <li>Author and date are light grey, 20px</li>
                <li>Text Body is black</li>
            </ul>

                 <P class="titles layout_title">LAYOUT</p>
                <p>The lightest websites would exist without any images or graphical elements. That said, imagery is an important part of communicating content. We used several techniques to minimize the server and data load for our images: heavily compressed dithered images, inline SVGs, and image sprites.
                    So, our images are dithered through the website DitherIt, which allows a different selection of algorithms and color options. Again, a basic color hierarchy is employed with opening images in darkgreen and articles images in blue.
                The so-called Solar Bar simulates the statistics of a solar server while offering some features to the user like the option of printing the page or a simple tool to estimate the carbon emissions of your web page.</p>
