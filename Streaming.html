<p id="ale1"><span class="first_letter">I</span>ndie rockers <a href="https://www.stolenjars.com/"><span class="band" about="Stolen Jars" data-label="Stolen Jars">Stolen Jars</span></a>  are not exactly <span class="band" about="Coldplay" data-label="Coldplay">Coldplay</span> or <span class="band" about="U2" data-label="U2">U2</span>, but they’re not a garage band either. They tour regularly and have been covered by <span class="newspaper" about="NPR" data-label="NPR">NPR</span> and <i><span class="newspaper" about="New York Times" data-label="New York Times">The New York Times</span></i>. They have a fanbase. They’ve placed one of their off-kilter songs in an iPad commercial. They currently have more than 22,000 monthly listeners on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>. Bandleader <span class="person" about='Cody Fitzgerald' data-label="Cody Fitzgerald">Cody Fitzgerald</span> estimates he makes about $1,500 to $2,000 every year from streaming services, which is good for about a month’s rent on his <span class="place" about="New York">New York</span> apartment.</p>
<p>That annual streaming income, <span class="person" about="Cody Fitzgerald" data-label="Cody Fitzgerald">Fitzgerald</span> is quick to note, is quite high for bands of <span class="band" about="Stolen Jars" data-label="Stolen Jars">Stolen Jars</span>’ stature. “Most people are on labels, which means they get, at most, 50 percent of that,” he says. <span class="person" about="Cody Fitzgerald" data-label="Cody Fitzgerald">Fitzgerald</span> self-releases <span class="band" about="Stolen Jars" data-label="Stolen Jars">Stolen Jars</span>’ albums. He is also the band’s primary songwriter and performs many of the instruments on the recordings himself, all of which entitles him to an unusually large share of the total payments from services like <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> and <span class= "mention streaming-service" about="Apple Music" data-label="Apple Music">Apple Music</span>.</p>


<p>
Musicians with different label and publishing situations—even those whose music is more popular—may make significantly less. <a href="https://tasminlittle.org.uk/"><span class="musician" about="Tasmin Little" data-label="Tasmin Little">Tasmin Little</span></a>, a celebrated classical violinist based in the <span class="place" about="UK" data-label="UK">UK</span>, has received honors including a Classic BRIT award and an Order of the British Empire designation from <span class="person" about="Queen Elizabeth" data-label="Queen Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</span>. She has more than 600,000 monthly listeners on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, and her recordings are featured on popular playlists like Classical Essentials, which has 1.9 million followers. <span class="musician" about="Tasmin Little" data-label="Tasmin Little">Little</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/tasminlittle/status/1262323181228036097">tweeted last month</a> that she was recently paid £12.34, or around $15.50, for six months of streaming on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, a period in which she would have had over 3.5 million total streams, according to her current statistics.
</p>

<p>When the coronavirus pandemic shut down the possibility of touring for the foreseeable future, cash-strapped musicians lost their most reliable way to make money. Revenue from streaming has always been small for many indie musicians, but now it is one of the few income sources available, along with sales of merch, physical records, and downloads on <span class="streaming-service" about="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</span>—a platform that has proven to be <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/how-much-more-money-artists-earn-from-bandcamp-compared-to-spotify-apple-music-youtube/">vastly more profitable</a> for many indie musicians compared to large streaming services. According to artists, the pandemic is only exacerbating the inequities of a system that is rigged against the people who make it run. Under these dire circumstances, musicians are organizing through unions and other advocacy groups to fight for larger payments from streaming platforms.</p>

<p>One such group is the <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/"><span class="organization" about="Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)">Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)"</span></a>, a new organization that counts Fitzgerald as a member of its steering committee, alongside members of bands like <span class="band" about="Speedy Ortiz"><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/">Speedy Ortiz</a></span> and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32890-downtown-boys/"><span class="band" about="Downtown Boys">Downtown Boys</span></a>. Another is the <a href="https://ivorsacademy.com/news/the-ivors-academy-and-musicians-union-launch-keep-music-alive-campaign-to-fix-streaming-now/"><span class="organization" about="Keep Music Alive">Keep Music Alive alliance</span></a>, a partnership between the <span class="organization" about="UK Musicians Union">UK’s Musicians Union</span> and songwriters association the <span class="organization" about="Ivors Academy">Ivors Academy</span> , which joined forces after the pandemic’s onset, aiming to remedy the “woefully insufficient” payments made from streaming services, according to a mission statement. These organizations differ in approach, location, and scale—the <span class="organization" about="UK Musicians Union">Musicians’ Union</span> was formed in the 19th century and represents 30,000 people; <span class="organization" about="Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)">UMAW</span> was formed in May and its current membership numbers in the hundreds—but both are responding to the same crisis.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any friends who don’t have some kind of financial worries right now,” says <span class="person" about="Sadie Dupuis">Sadie Dupuis</span>, <span class="organization" about="Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)">UMAW</span> founding member and guitarist-songwriter of <span class="band" about="Speedy Ortiz">Speedy Ortiz</span>. “For most musicians I know who are touring full-time, the work they have outside of that is all based in the service industry, and they can’t get back into that either.” According to <span class="person" about="Mark Taylor">Mark Taylor</span>, communications director of the <span class="organization" about="Ivors Academy">Ivors Academy</span>, the situation represents nothing less than an existential crisis over the future of music itself. “We really just want to keep music alive,” he says. “It’s good for us, it’s good for our souls, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for culture.”</p>

<p>In the <span class="place" about="UK">UK</span>, the <span class="organization" about="Keep Music Alive">Keep Music Alive alliance</span> campaign is pushing for a government review of the streaming industry, which it hopes will result in additional regulations over the way payments are doled out. The <span class="organization" about="Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)">UMAW</span>, as a new organization aimed at a host of issues including streaming, has not yet formalized a set of demands for changes. Both groups acknowledge that the process of fixing streaming will be as complicated as the recognition of its brokenness is simple.</p>

<h3 class="paragraph_header">How do streaming payments work?</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">

<p>Artists receive, on average, a small fraction of a cent for each time one of their songs is streamed on a major platform. A seemingly obvious fix would be for the platforms to simply increase this number. But while these tiny per-stream payments are a useful concept for identifying the problem, they’re not particularly useful for solving it, because they don’t reflect the mechanism by which the platforms actually distribute money.</p>


<p>According to <a href="https://soundcharts.com/blog/music-streaming-rates-payouts">a detailed survey of streaming payments</a> by the music industry analytics company <span class="organization" about="Soundcharts">Soundcharts</span>, streaming platforms pay out roughly 60 to 70 percent of their annual revenue to “rightsholders,” a group that includes musicians, record labels, songwriters, publishers—anyone who has a financial stake in the sales of a given record. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, the most popular platform in the <span class="place" about="U.S">U.S</span>. and globally, projected a total revenue between roughly $9 and $9.5 billion for 2020 in <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2019.pdf">a recent letter to shareholders</a>, which would make the total rightsholders’ take something like $6 billion for this year. That huge pile of money is then divvied up to artists (and their associated labels and so on) according to their stream counts as a fraction of the total streams on the platform for a given period. A single stream does not entitle a musician to a payment of some fixed amount; it entitles them to a slightly larger piece of the total rightsholders’ pie.</p>

<p>To understand why per-stream payments can be an unrepresentative metric, imagine no one streamed anything on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> for all of 2020, except for a single person who played, say, <span class="band" about="100 gecs">100 gecs’</span> <span class="song" about="Money Machine">“Money Machine”</span> a single time. As long as those hypothetical non-listeners didn’t cancel their subscriptions, and money kept rolling in to <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, that one play could earn <span class="band" about="100 gecs">100 gecs</span> millions of dollars, because it would entitle them to the whole pie.</p>

<p><span class="organization" about="Soundcharts">Soundcharts</span> offers another way of looking at it. Each time <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> introduces a new feature aimed at keeping people listening for longer, like autoplaying similar artists after you finish an album, it sends the average per-stream figure down. That’s not because <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> is suddenly skimping on payments, but because people are streaming more songs—and when people stream more songs, a single stream is equivalent to a smaller pie slice. That’s fine for established artists whose music is regularly recommended by these listener-retention features, because the dilution in value of a single stream is offset by an increase in streams. But for artists who aren’t being recommended, it means their streams are worth less.</p>

<h3 class="paragraph_header">How could platforms make payments bigger?</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">

<p>Though making streaming services work better for musicians is not as straightforward as demanding a higher payment per stream, there are several ways the system could theoretically be changed to get more money into artists’ pockets. Most obviously, companies like <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> could increase the 60 to 70 percent share of their revenue that they pay out to rightsholders.</p>

<p>But if recent history is any indication, that number is likely to go down before it goes up. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> renegotiated its deals with labels in 2017; before that, the payout number was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e913f2d8-74b9-11e4-b30b-00144feabdc0">more like 80 percent</a>. At the time, the labels agreed to have their payments cut—thereby reducing musicians’ payments as well—because they believed they needed <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> in order to ensure their own survival. With streaming accounting for an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/music-revenue-surges-on-streaming-subscription-growth-11567708974">ever-increasing majority share of the recording industry’s revenue</a> each year, the labels probably won’t be changing their minds about that anytime soon.</p>

<p>But even if <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> and the labels reverted back to the old deals, it doesn’t seem like it would do much for the average musician; it’s not as though indie bands were rolling in dough from streaming back in 2015. Groups advocating for bigger streaming payments could demand that <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> give up an even larger revenue share—90 percent, say—but it’s hard to imagine <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> would agree to it. Even the labels, who would have to sign off on such a deal and would be its chief beneficiaries, seem more inclined to accept <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>’s word that they’re better off making less money so that <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> can thrive.</p>

<p>Another option would be to advocate for the platforms to increase their subscription price. Higher monthly fees means more revenue; more revenue increases the size of the overall pie given out to rightsholders; a bigger pie means bigger slices for all musicians. But while most music fans likely agree that artists deserve more money, asking listeners to pay up themselves is trickier. “It’s interesting, the price of a subscription has stayed static for a number of years,” says <span class="person" about="Mark Taylor">Taylor</span> of the <span class="organization" about="Keep Music Alive">Keep Music Alive</span> alliance. “But frankly, given where we are economically right now, and pressure on peoples’ wallets, that’s probably not the route to go down as a campaign.”</p>

<p>Instead, <span class="organization" about="Keep Music Alive">Keep Music Alive</span> advocates for overhauling the payment system entirely, toward what’s known as a <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-there-a-fairer-way-for-streaming-services-to-pay-artists/">user-centric model</a>, which would apportion the subscription fee from each user to the artists they actually listened to that month. If I only listen to <span class="band" about="100 gecs">100 gecs</span>, my $9.99—minus <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>’s take—goes directly to <span class="band" about="100 gecs">100 gecs</span> and their label.</p>


<p>The current system, known as pro rata, <a href="https://qz.com/1660465/the-way-spotify-and-apple-music-pays-artists-isnt-fair/">gives more financial weight</a> to the preferences of users who stream more songs, whereas user-centric payments would treat the preferences of all users equally. <span class="person" about="Mark Taylor">Taylor</span> says the user-centric model is a better reflection of how listeners interact with the artists they love outside of the streaming realm: “We choose to go to gigs, to buy merchandise, and part of that exchange is, ‘I want my money to go to this artist, so they can make a living, and do more of what they do.’ That is a very distinct relationship that currently doesn’t work, really, in streaming.”</p>

<p>A user-centric model is appealing in the abstract, and there is reason to believe it could financially benefit some smaller artists in the long run. According to a <a href="http://www.muusikkojenliitto.fi/usercentric/">2017</a> study by the <span class="organization" about="Finnish Music Publishers Association">Finnish Music Publishers Association</span>, 10 percent of all streaming revenue flows to the top .4 percent of artists under the pro rata system. The study found that a user-centric system would cut the revenue to that top tier nearly in half and increase the overall flow of money to less popular artists. However, some individual small artists ended up receiving less money under a user-centric system in the study’s simulation. The French streaming platform <span class="streaming-service" about="Deezer">Deezer</span> <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-there-a-fairer-way-for-streaming-services-to-pay-artists/">announced</a> a switch to user-centric payments last year, but for now there is little real-world data showing its effects one way or the other.</p>
<h3 class="paragraph_header">What about labels?</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">
<p>Streaming platforms do not make payments directly to musicians, but rather to labels, distributors, publishers, and copyright collection societies, all of whom take their own cuts before passing the money along. The share of revenue that ends up in a performing artist’s pocket also depends on factors that have more to do with these other parties than the streaming services themselves: chiefly, whether the artists are performing their own compositions or someone else’s, and the size of the splits they’ve negotiated with their label over revenue from their recordings. These factors may help explain why a songwriter with no label like <span class="band" about="Stolen Jars">Stolen Jars</span>’ <span class="person" about="Cody Fitzgerald">Cody Fitzgerald</span> makes more money from streaming than a signed artist who mostly performs works by other composers like <span class="musician" about="Tasmin Little">Tasmin Little</span>, despite the greater popularity of <span class="musician" about="Tasmin Little">Little</span>’s recordings.</p>
<p>The label’s cut of an artist’s streaming revenue varies from artist to artist and label to label, and the contracts that govern it aren’t generally made public. But several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/business/media/spotify-music-industry-record-labels.html">experts</a> <a href="https://medium.com/soundeon/what-is-the-typical-revenue-split-between-labels-and-artists-for-streaming-royalties-8812fbafed23">estimate</a> that labels get anywhere from 50 to 85 percent. Fifty-fifty splits are common to indie labels; majors generally take a larger share.</p>
<p>The <span class="organization" about="Keep Music Alive">Keep Music Alive</span> campaign broadly presents itself as a critique of the streaming industry, but its specific platform focuses equally on the role of labels. According to <span class="person" about="Mark Taylor">Taylor</span>, the 85 percent a major label might take from an artist’s revenue is no longer justified in the streaming era. “A lot of that is a hangup from when they had larger overheads, from when they had to store and ship CDs,” he says. “There was a cost to all of that, which is now largely being reduced. We’re basing this new system on outdated models.”</p>

<h3 class="paragraph_header">What's next?</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">
<p>For musicians facing an undeniably appealing and increasingly dominant technology that threatens to usurp their livelihood, resistance can seem futile. It would be foolish to pretend that streaming isn’t an amazing service from a listener’s perspective, or that it will go away just because it doesn’t seem fair. Talk to enough musicians and you’ll find plenty who are vocal critics of streaming, but still host their albums on streaming services and are subscribers themselves.</p>
<p>“It would be great to strike a new balance, because these streaming services are really helpful in terms of music discovery—I buy more records than I used to, because I can get psyched up on something new without having to go to the listening station at the Virgin Megastore,” says <span class="person" about="Sadie Dupuis">Dupuis</span>. “But the discrepancy between what mega-corporations are pulling in off artists’ music and what we’re pulling in is pretty gross.”</p>
<p>An individual musician who’s inclined to protest that discrepancy has limited options. They could pull their catalog from the platforms, but that seems doomed to fail as anything other than an act of symbolism.“Unless there’s a big collective action to do that, that will not do anything,” <span class="person" about="Cody Fitzgerald">Fitzgerald</span> says. “If you do it by yourself, it will just make it so you can’t grow your fanbase, so you can’t be a band.”</p>

<p><span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>'s problems with paying musicians may be inextricable from its value proposition to subscribers: $9.99 per month is an incredibly small price to pay for push-button access to nearly the entire history of recorded music. Practically every musician on <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> is vying for their piece of the pie, and there just may not be enough to go around. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> understandably wants to make money, and probably deserves something for its development of the technology itself. But even if it conceded to pay 100 percent of its revenue to rightsholders, and somehow managed to continue operating, the payouts under the current system would still be paltry for many musicians. Take <span class="musician" about="Tasmin Little">Tasmin Little</span>’s $15.50 for six months of streaming. Multiply that by 10—a factor which would far exceed <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>’s total revenue if it were applied to its entire catalog—and it’s still only $15</p>

<p>Recognizing the futility of the situation doesn’t inure musicians to its indignities, which have continued rolling in as the pandemic pause stretches into an epoch of its own. First, there was the virtual “tip jar” that <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> rolled out as an optional add-on to artist pages, which allowed listeners to donate money to musicians directly—an apparently well-intentioned gesture that nonetheless served as a tacit admission that streaming revenue could never keep most artists afloat on its own, even as <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> subscriptions and revenue <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/spotify-spot-earnings-q1-2020.html">surged</a> during the early weeks of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Then, there was the news that <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> had paid the wildly popular podcaster <span class="person" about="Joe Rogan">Joe Rogan</span> over $100 million for exclusive rights to his show, the latest indicator of a larger priority shift toward podcasts for the company. <span class="person" about="Ted Gioia">Ted Gioia</span>, a music historian and jazz pianist, summed up musicians’ frustrations with a <a href="https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276?lang=en">tweet</a>: “A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> to earn what they’re paying <span class="person" about="Joe Rogan">Joe Rogan</span> for his podcast rights… In other words, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> values <span class="person" about="Joe Rogan">Rogan</span> more than any musician in the history of the world. Sound fair to you?”</p>

<p>I emailed <span class="person" about="Ted Gioia">Gioia</span>, who has written <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/books/review/music-subversive-history-ted-gioia.html">a celebrated book</a> on music’s power to subvert existing orders, to ask if there’s any way that musicians, and the listeners who love them, can change the streaming system for the better. In a thoughtful and lengthy response, he chastised the record industry for failing to keep up with technological innovations on its own, allowing tech companies like <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> to swoop in and set the negotiating terms. He pointed out that individual musicians have little to no leverage in their dealings with streaming platforms, despite the fact that their music makes those platforms run. He called the prospect of convincing platforms to pay musicians more a “pipe dream.”</p>

<p id="advnextissue">Despite all this, he ended his message with a faint note of hope. One way to fix things, he wrote, “would involve musicians taking control of their own destiny,” and walking away from streaming en masse to start something new. “Make no mistake, musicians could run their own streaming and distribution platforms, and reallocate the cash toward the people who create the songs,” he continued. “No, I don’t expect any of these things to happen. I’m just saying they could happen.”</p>

<p id="ale2">Timeless: the sound of scanning airwaves, tuning the car radio on the highway, parsing through millisecond snippets of voice. Ch&mdash;. A sound in the collective memory, preserved beyond its analog lifespan. Kh&mdash;. Like the floppy disk as Save icon. Sh&mdash;. Like a white-noise TV screen, so you have to adjust the antenna. Ch&mdash;. Kh&mdash;. Sh&mdash;. Vestigial structures of the digital&nbsp;age.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;I&#8217;m <span class="person" about="Ryan Seacrest"> Ryan Seacrest</span> &amp; you&#8217;re tuned into KRCK, the #1 Hit Music&nbsp;Station.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yusef: <i>That&#8217;s mostly how I was exposed to music when I was younger. Taking the bus home from school … They used to put on TOP 40 radio &amp; I mean you&#8217;re a kid, you can&#8217;t really tell what&#8217;s good or bad &mdash; you know, you think it&#8217;s good &#8216;cause it&#8217;s popular or whatever. I used to like browsing the electronics section at the department stores &mdash; I guess I still do (laughs) &mdash; &amp; I&#8217;d hover around the boomboxes &amp; every so often I&#8217;d pick up on something cool. I used to think there was a set schedule for songs, like TV shows; so I&#8217;d go back home &amp; the next day I&#8217;d tune in at the exact same time to see if I could hear it again … Damn, I was dumb (laughs).</i></font></p>
<p>Then <span class="tv-channel" about="MTV">MTV</span>, <span class="tv-channel" about="VH1">VH1</span>, <span class="tv-channel" about="HTV">HTV</span>, <span class="tv-channel" about="Fuse">Fuse</span>, <span class="tv-channel" about="Mazzika">Mazzika</span>. Zeitgeist markers: major tastemakers &amp; career-breakers, skyrocketing in popularity for a couple of decades with their daily countdowns, live-show features, flashy big-budget videos &mdash; iconic artifacts of the era. You got absorbed into the spectacle. Assimilated, I don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s gone too, now. At least in that&nbsp;form.</p>

<p>Reem: <i>In the beginning, with me listening to music … it was on TV, you know. I&#8217;d go on TV channels &#8216;specifically for music &mdash; <span class="tv-channel" about="MTV">MTV</span>, bla-bla-bla &mdash; &amp; I was listening to music from movies, like Mary Poppins &mdash; I had it on VHS. But really TV, I mean in the morning before school &amp; I was getting ready, or when I came back it was always in the background when I was doing homework … Mostly I tuned it out until they put on something I liked &amp; I got distracted &amp; just watched (laughs) … Do they even have those channels still?</i></p>

<p>Video didn&#8217;t totally dispatch the radio star, even if now those top-hits stations are just fodder for department store Muzak. But the internet &mdash; the internet <i>annihilated</i> music television. Like, yeah, Reem &mdash; there are channels. <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> channels. As many as you want. Everyone &amp; their mother&#8217;s got a <span class="streaming-service" about="VEVO">VEVO</span>, a &#8220;Topic&#8221; page or whatever. But what&#8217;s game-changing about the internet is the <i>escape</i> from mediation: the user as radio DJ, as TV&nbsp;producer.</p>

<p>Xavi: <i>Joda, I remember when <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> opened &mdash; umm, started? &mdash; &amp; that&#8217;s when I got into J-Rock &#8216;cause I used to watch shit-tons of AMVs &mdash; that was the first <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> video I ever saw &mdash; so I kept digging around for the opening &amp; closing songs for the shows I liked &amp; such. Looking back, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. Like there was no other way I&#8217;d ever be exposed to any of that on the radio or whatever.</i></p>

<p id="adv8000">See, that&#8217;s the thing: <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> wasn&#8217;t just an online library of music television. No, the dynamic spirit of the internet resides in that element of surprise: the creative act of crate-digging internet archives, of choose-your-own-adventure rabbit holes dug into the sediments of the music industry architecture. Oh, but there was another way. Another type of platform that really captured that&nbsp;freedom.</p>

<p><span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> &amp; the streaming services that have emerged in its wake, particularly <span class="streaming-service" about="Apple Music">Apple Music</span> &amp; <span class="streaming-service" about="Tidal">TIDAL</span>, have come to wholly redefine the framework of digital music consumption today, having no clear analog counterpart as did, say, online radio &amp; video platforms.</q></p>

<p>Gabo: <i>I&#8217;m too young for <span class="streaming-service" about="Napster">Napster</span>. Osea, I was just starting to &#8220;get into&#8221; music around the time it was getting shut down … so I didn&#8217;t get to use it, as opposed to other P2P clients. I think most of my friends were using <span class="streaming-service" about="Limewire">Limewire</span>, but I was using <span class="streaming-service" about="Ares">Ares</span>. It was all part of one big thing for me. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t just about downloading music, but also movies, wallpapers, whatever. I think the first porn I ever saw was I accidentally downloaded it when I was searching for DBZ wallpapers or something (laughs). You know what I mean?</i></p>

<p>Yeah, but kids coming of age today probably won&#8217;t. Most of those filesharing clients were brutally shut down. Copyright reasons; intellectual property gobbledygook. Ultimately, &#8220;they&#8217;re cutting into industry sales,&#8221; which is apparently statistically verifiable. Either way, for many of us, this internet black market was a window into a realm of infinite&nbsp;possibility.</p>
<p><i>Oh, right &mdash; &amp; you know I&#8217;m a producer now, &amp; those early years when we were just fucking around with the software I was downloading tons of super random techno &mdash; I mean, probably shitty bedroom producers like me at the time &mdash; but I was eating it up … &amp; I was really into this really tacky Swedish producer, <span class="musician" about="Basshunter">Basshunter</span> &mdash; &amp; I downloaded a kit of samples he was using &#8216;cause I wanted to sound like him &amp; &mdash; wait, don&#8217;t put that in the interview (laughs).</i></font></p>

<p>But the thing is: we&#8217;re coming at it from the wrong angle. Remember that filesharing didn’t just give us free access to corporate property. Carrying a random assortment of user-generated content, it was a platform for independent artists &mdash; especially “outsider” artists &mdash; to share their work without passing through the corporate bureaucracy to begin with. Particularly for artists residing outside the world’s culture hubs, the internet was a direct conduit &mdash; the only conduit &mdash; from the bedroom to the&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>Obviously the capabilities of filesharing only went so far. Fortunately, more productive spaces for artists to share their work outside corporate mediation eventually arose in the form of <span class="streaming-service" about="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</span> &amp; <span class="streaming-service" about="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</span>, which, in this regard, are two sides of the same coin: they both give creators the freedom to share on their own terms, depending on their own needs &amp; ambitions. <span class="streaming-service" about="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</span>, with its emphasis on its user community &amp; social features, gave way to the proliferation of entire scenes &amp; communities, even propelling a number of artists to the mainstream through the sheer power of word-of-mouth. Meanwhile, <span class="streaming-service" about="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</span>’s flexible marketplace allows users to contribute directly to artists &amp; delegates to artists control over the terms of the exchange &mdash; a non-starter in the music&nbsp;industry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the discourse regarding online music consumption don’t consider these independent actors, because everything is subsumed into a dichotomy of the corporate (the ones who sell) vs. the renegade (the ones who steal). In other words, those without capitalist ambitions &mdash; including many artists on <span class="streaming-service" about="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</span> &amp; <span class="streaming-service" about="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</span> &mdash; simply don’t&nbsp;exist. </p>

<p>In this environment, then, how much of <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span>’s success as early digital music platform simple coincidence? Just as filesharing clients were facing tough legal battles, the industry was starting to give us alternatives to “piracy” &mdash; freely-available streaming. Under the sheen of these shiny new options, though, was that scary implication: Only a few decades after its inception, already the anarchic freedom of cyberspace had become the domain of fierce contestation. Once these counter-hegemonic conduits were altogether blocked, their inheritors didn&#8217;t feel much different from their offline counterparts: <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> was music television; <span class="streaming-service" about="Pandora">Pandora</span> &mdash; the radio; <span class="streaming-service" about="iTunes">iTunes</span> &mdash; retail&nbsp;shops.</p>

<p>That was the state of streaming before streaming was streaming. Later, after a series of false starts by various aspirants, a new player came to define the way music is consumed online&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Adrian: <i>Actually, I&#8217;m the one who got everyone into <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>. I mean, in the beginning, when nobody knew what it was. I was just starting to get really into music, so for my purposes, everything I needed was on there. So I was raving about it. I think at the time my music library was a hot mess &amp; it just seemed easier to stream everything … Anyway I got everyone to use it &amp; to follow me, so I would spam everyone by sending them music &mdash; can you still do that? Anyway, I stopped using it. I download everything now, &amp; I support whomever I can on <span class="streaming-service" about="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</span>.</i></p>


<p>Thing is, though: they&#8217;re a continuation &mdash; a substantiation &mdash; of a comprehensive process that&#8217;s been drastically changing the panorama of the internet &amp; the rules that govern it: who can use it, when they can use it, how much they can use it, for what they can use it &mdash; &amp;, of course, who profits from&nbsp;it.</p>

</figure>




<p>In order to understand how the panorama of the internet has changed, though, we have to return to the basics. For media scholar <span class="person" about="Lincoln Dahlberg">Lincoln Dahlberg</span>, it&#8217;s &#8220;the two-way, decentralized, and time/distance-defying communication of cyberspace&#8221; that makes the online sphere unique. Discussing the internet&#8217;s ability to cultivate the public discourse, he argued that its emancipatory potential dwells in these aspects, which set it apart from other media &amp; &#8220;[offer] the basis by which to enable otherwise marginalized voices to be heard and for dominant discourses and power relations to be&nbsp;contested.&#8221;</p>

<p>As more people gained access to the internet throughout the 1990s, there was growing excitement about the potential of unmediated communication &mdash; the internet as 24-hour agora, a never-ending town hall. Everyone was in on it. Vanity websites were cropping up all over; so too were forums, churning out discussion threads on the daily. <span class="website" about="GeoCities">GeoCities</span> was a bustling metropolis of the internet&#8217;s first content creators (this is where TMT started too). Subcultures found new spaces to thrive. This &#8220;internet&#8221; thing was <i>the place to be</i>.</p>

<p>Some of that remains true today, to be fair. But <span class="person" about="Lincoln Dahlberg">Dahlberg</span> &amp; some fellow scholars aren&#8217;t wholly optimistic. &#8220;Powerful corporations supported by neoliberal policies,&#8221; <span class="person" about="Lincoln Dahlberg">Dahlberg</span> writes, &#8220;are increasingly gaining ownership […] of cyberspace and beginning to discriminate in favour of certain voices and practices.&#8221; It&#8217;s a process <span class="person" about="Lincoln Dahlberg">Dahlberg</span> &amp; others have been calling the <i>corporate colonization of cyberspace</i>.</p>


<p>Even though the internet &#8220;is not currently owned by any one corporation or government&#8221; &mdash; the theory goes &mdash; corporations can exercise disproportionate influence online given the sheer volume of internet content; &#8220;the route to the domination of online practice is the domination of <i>online attention</i>.&#8221; In other words, even though there are many spaces preserved for critical communication contrary to corporate interests &amp; away from corporate mediation &mdash; you&#8217;re reading one *wink* &mdash; these spaces are too often overwhelmed by corporate content (sorry, Mr P). As <span class="person" about="Lincoln Dahlberg">Dahlberg</span> writes in &#8220;<span class="book" about="The Corporate Colonization of Online&nbsp;Attention&#8221;">The Corporate Colonization of Online&nbsp;Attention&#8221;</span>:</p>

<p><blockquote class="quote">With millions of Web pages, and millions more messages passing through e-mail and discussion groups, being noticed by any more than a handful of people is extremely difficult for most online participants. This is not the case for large media and communication corporations. They can gain significant audience attention given their established branding, strong customer loyalty, extensive product lines, large marketing budgets, and the capital to develop and buy up internet service providers (ISPs), user applications, Web sites, and online content&nbsp;… </blockquote></p>

<p>Oh &mdash; right, that was in 2005. You know what else was around in 2005? <span class="website" about="AOL">AOL</span> &amp; <span class="website" about="MSN">MSN</span>. People were searching for shit on <i>Yahoo</i>. We&#8217;re talking when <span class="website" about="MySpace">Myspace</span> was the biggest social network &amp; users were checking @hotmail.com accounts. When <span class="website" about="Google">Google</span> was <i>just</i> a search engine; <span class="website" about="Gmail">Gmail</span> &amp; <span class="website" about="Chrome">Chrome</span> were nowhere to be found. It was the year <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span> was founded &amp; barely anyone noticed back then. <span class="website" about="Facebook">Facebook</span> wasn&#8217;t even open to the public until 2006, the year <span class="website" about="Twitter">Twitter</span> &amp; <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> were born into&nbsp;obscurity.</p>

<p>Which is to say: the panorama of the internet has changed <i>drastically</i> since the time of Dahlberg&#8217;s writing. Yet his words are prescient. In fact, it&#8217;s possible things are only getting worse, as the internet becomes increasingly centralized by a few dominant&nbsp;monopolies.</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s not simply a question of discourse anymore: <span class="website" about="Google">Google</span> mediates your web searching, web browsing (<span class="website" about="Chrome">Chrome</span>), cloud storage (<span class="website" about="Drive">Drive</span>), video viewing (<span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span>, email (<span class="website" about="Gmail">Gmail</span>). <span class="website" about="Facebook">Facebook</span> mediates your online network times two (with <span class="website" about="Instagram">Instagram</span>) &amp; your communications times two (<span class="website" about="WhatsApp">WhatsApp</span> &amp; <span class="website" about="Messenger">Messenger</span>). That&#8217;s just two companies. Yeah, sure, there&#8217;s <span class="website" about="Firefox">Firefox</span>, there&#8217;s <span class="website" about="Vimeo">Vimeo</span>, there&#8217;s <span class="website" about="Outlook">Outlook</span>, there&#8217;s… umm, <span class="website" about="MySpace">Myspace</span>? But, really, in the war for online attention, the winners are&nbsp;obvious.</p>


<p>If this isn&#8217;t news to you, it ain&#8217;t news for ISPs, either. Dominating online attention is one thing; now <i>structural</i> changes to the internet are underway too. You&#8217;ve probably heard of internet companies&#8217; wildly unpopular recent attempts to undermine net neutrality. Proponents of these efforts would permit ISPs to charge different rates for different tiers of internet access, turning the internet into a sort of &#8220;freemium&#8221; subscription service &mdash; except there&#8217;s no totally &#8220;free&#8221; tier. In this scenario, an &#8220;internet starter pack&#8221; might include only common <span class="website" about="Google">Google</span> &amp; <span class="website" about="Facebook">Facebook</span> products, artificially slowing down access to other content. It&#8217;s a punishment similar to, say, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> spamming free users with&nbsp;ads.</p>

<p>Something of this nature would&#8217;ve been much harder to pull off 20+ years ago. Whereas online attention today is so monopolized by a few companies that, without favoring such reform whatsoever, it&#8217;s probably fair to say that a significant constituency of internet users would be perfectly happy with fast access merely to the <span class="website" about="Google">Google</span> &amp; <span class="website" about="Facebook">Facebook</span> products that constitute the majority of their browsing. Once the corporate <i>colonization</i> of the internet set the stage to destabilize net neutrality, these companies are trying to capitalize on the harvest &mdash; the <i>centralization</i> of the&nbsp;internet.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s this centralization that marks the ways in which the panorama of the internet is changing. Because, though one can&#8217;t &#8220;own&#8221; the internet (yet), centralization isn&#8217;t about ownership; you don&#8217;t have to own the internet to govern it. Dahlberg knew this: in his assessment, he points to decentralization as one of the internet&#8217;s important features &mdash; &amp; that&#8217;s one of the important differences between then &amp; now. Absent the monopolies of today, indeed, you might refer to the early internet as <i>anarchic</i>.</p>

<p>With respect to not only communication, but also flows of data. It was this online anarchy that facilitated the proliferation of early P2P clients such as  <span class="streaming-service" about="Limewire">Limewire</span> &amp; <span class="streaming-service" about="Ares">Ares</span> &mdash; not to mention the groundbreaking  <span class="streaming-service" about="Napster">Napster</span>. Just folks trading files back &amp; forth, not much in between other than the program itself as facilitator; much of the time, though, a free giving outside of an equivalent exchange &mdash; a sort of info altruism, a data anti-capitalism, a micro-communism. That&#8217;s why corporations enjoyed both a material &amp; a <i>symbolic</i> victory when these platforms were shut down. It meant anarchy was on its way out; the internet was getting <i>organized</i>, &amp; corporate capitalism was calling the&nbsp;shots.</p>

<p>Because centralizing the internet means extending capitalism&#8217;s rules-of-the-game into cyberspace. Regardless of one&#8217;s stance on piracy, the restriction of filesharing to a few sanctioned, corporate-mediated platforms (e.g., <span class="streaming-service" about="iTunes">iTunes</span>, <span class="streaming-service" about="YouTube">YouTube</span>) has contributed significantly to the ability of corporations to enforce their vision of &#8220;fair use&#8221; &amp; regulate <i>what</i> we access on the internet, <i>who</i> can access it, <i>when</i> &amp; <i>where</i> we access it, &amp; <i>how</i> we access it. Think &#8220;this content is not available due to a copyright violation.&#8221; Think &#8220;this content is not available in your&nbsp;country.&#8221;</p>


<p>By this time, the damage was already done. Once the internet made free access the expectation, establishing new restrictions upon it represented an obvious regression. We went from free downloads to 30-second clips on <span class="streaming-service" about="iTunes">iTunes</span>? Give me a break. That&#8217;s why the genesis of online streaming services is arguably just a sign of the times. They&#8217;re the culmination of the processes of internet colonization &amp; centralization, yet they represent a direct response to the irreversible changes in the fabric of the corporate music industry wrought by the anarchy of the internet: a shameless co-optation &mdash; for capitalism, a <i>redemption</i> &mdash; of the forbidden &#8220;market&#8221; that P2P first&nbsp;established.</p>

<p>But aside from representing a symptom of the current panorama of the internet &amp; entailing significant repercussions for the music industry, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s current hegemony inaugurates a new era for &#8220;consumers&#8221; complete with observable changes to our contemporary interactions with music, which are sure to carve their own enduring marks not just on our &#8220;consumption&#8221; habits, but on how we view, invent, &amp; construct ourselves in relation to music; the way we arrange, reposition, organize, share, catalogue, frame, tag, compartmentalize, &amp; jostle with it; the spaces it occupies &amp; doesn&#8217;t occupy in our lives; the <i>uses</i> we ascribe to it, the conditions that make it <i>useless</i>, &amp; the times at which it&#8217;s both &mdash; or&nbsp;neither.</p>


<h3 class="paragraph_header">II. PRESENT: The Use &amp; Abuse of Music in the Age of&nbsp;<span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>
</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">

<figure class="article_2_3">
    <img class="img-fluid article_images" src="imgs/article_2_3.jpg" id="third_image_second_article">
</figure>

<p>Writing at the time of Nazi ascendancy in <span class="place" about="Germany">Germany</span>, <span class="person" about="Walter Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</span> identified that the &#8220;proletarianization&#8221; of humankind would pose a unique challenge to fascist ideologues who sought mass public appeal without any intent to change the structures oppressing that same public. Such a feat was only accomplished through appeals to ideology: &#8220;Fascism sees its salvation,&#8221; <span class="person" about="Walter Benjamin">Benjamin</span> writes, &#8220;in giving [the newly created proletarian] masses […] a chance to express themselves,&#8221; offering changes to the <i>optics</i> of the proletariat&#8217;s material conditions while in reality obscuring the ossification of the property structure. &#8220;The masses have a right to change property relations,&#8221; <span class="person" about="Walter Benjamin">Benjamin</span> states. &#8220;Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving&nbsp;property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Building on this tradition, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> represents a reactionary cyber-fascism that follows from the micro-communisms of P2P networks that it contributes to stamping out. Whereas P2P networks transform capitalist property relations by disaggregating the purchaser-owner equality &amp; redistributing the fruits of work through cyberspace (though the &#8220;work&#8221; in question is not the production of content, but the searching, archiving, uploading, etc. thereof), streaming services employ &#8220;licensing&#8221; to stage a pantomime of the anarchy that actually enables the rearrangement of property&nbsp;relations.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s, of course, the key to their success: the optics. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> might <i>mimic</i> the free access of P2P networks with a vast database that recreates the wealth of content available via filesharing. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> might <i>emulate</i> user agency with verbs such as &#8220;save&#8221; &amp; &#8220;share&#8221; &mdash; not to mention playlist creation. Yet it remains structurally embedded in the capitalist system &mdash; specifically, the corporate music industry &mdash; that defines the rules of the game &amp; enforces them in order to stamp out spaces outside&nbsp;mediation.</p>

<p>One of the frightening outcomes of <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s hegemony is that many have internalized their mimicry. Many interact with streaming services as though they&#8217;re a definitive repository of contemporary music. Availability is equated with relevance: that which isn&#8217;t on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, conversely, is <i>irrelevant</i>. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> is a degree-granting institution that certifies that your music <i>exists</i>.</p>
<p>By co-opting the destabilized property relations of P2P networks &amp; subtly requiring non-corporate actors to register in their scheme under the threat of excommunication, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> centralizes music consumption under one roof &amp; advances the expansion of capitalism into&nbsp;cyberspace.</p>
        <p><h3 class="paragraph_header">CASE I: The Algorithm</h3></p>
        <hr class="half-hr">
<p>One of the important fruits of centralization in this case is the ability to generate abundant data via monitoring every aspect of users&#8217; habits. Of course, this data is fed back to the industry, but it also contributes to &#8220;improving&#8221; the streaming service&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just one way in which our interactions with music are changing &mdash; or, rather, not. In theory, the internet offers a medium for exploration &amp; self-creation outside the mediation of radio stations, music television, etc. But cyberspace operates under its own architecture, which is by no means arbitrary: the algorithms that carve out the pathways of cyberspace don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; they are drawn up by humans &amp; are frequently altered in favor of certain types of content &amp; online&nbsp;interactions.</p>
<p>In the age of <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, this makes algorithms a valuable commodity. On <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, we&#8217;re subjected to the tyranny of the algorithm, which was co-opted &amp; has since fully invaded &amp; rearranged the exploratory space of the internet. Algorithms underpin everything from chart generation to search result delivery: pertinent results are overwhelmed by popular ones; copycats flock to capitalize on precious search terms; single tracks top artist pages, even of those loyal to the album&nbsp;format.</p>
<p>One algorithm to fit all &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t. Today, the algorithm plays an unprecedented role in demarcating the mainstream. But where these boundaries were once meant to <i>exclude</i> everything outside it, today the outside is being <i>assimilated</i> into the corporate template for the purposes of&nbsp;commodification.</p>
        <h3 class="paragraph_header">CASE II: The Playlist (Use-Value)</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">
<p>On <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, this commodification is expressed in the form of playlists. Browse the various playlists on offer to get a quick overview of the strategies &amp; aesthetics of capitalism today. <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s selection of playlists frankly demonstrates a few of the company&#8217;s most successful trademark features, just one of which is the abundance of use-oriented&nbsp;playlists.</p>

<p>Categories of &#8220;uses&#8221; often seek to change, maintain, or match the consumption context &amp; the state of consumers, whether it corresponds to an <i>emotional</i> state (Coping With Loss, The PMS Playlist); a <i>cognitive</i> state (Confidence Boost, Creativity Boost, Focus Now, Music for Concentration, Perfect Concentration); an <i>activity</i> (Reading Soundtrack, Reading Chill Out, Read &amp; Unwind, Reading Adventure, Summer Reading); a <i>time</i> (Wake Up Happy, Wake Up Gently, Autumn Acoustic, Winter Sounds). Sometimes they are filtered by genre to match individual preferences (House Focus, Classical Focus, Electronic Focus, Soft Focus, Binaural Beats Focus); sometimes by demographic (Baby Sleep, Sleep Baby Sleep, Harp Lullabies); &amp; sometimes they just fetishize (Dreamcatcher, Vibra&nbsp;Tropical).</p>

<p>Such explicit marketing of music&#8217;s use-value above its other qualities is a recent tendency &amp; represents a significant shift in the way we ascribe value to music. Even shameless cash-grab compilations (e.g., the <i>Now That&#8217;s What I Call Music!</i> series) never published anything along the lines of &#8220;Now That&#8217;s What I Call Rainy-Day Study Music!&#8221; Yet such products account for a massive slice of the content available today among <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s featured&nbsp;playlists.</p>

<p>Notice that the would-be genre tag of &#8220;study music&#8221; &mdash; arguably the most popular &#8220;genre&#8221; emerging out of this process &mdash; doesn&#8217;t refer to the music&#8217;s aesthetic qualities but rather to its <i>function</i>. <span class="musician" about="Brian Eno">Brian Eno</span> anticipates this early on when he describes ambient music explicitly as music to play in the background. In fact, the mostly-recent entry of <span class="genre" about="ambient music">ambient music</span> into the mainstream only further points to the ascendency of <i>use</i> in the industry: among these changes in consumption habits, ambient music entered the mainstream <i>qua</i> study music, <i>qua</i> sleep music, <i>qua</i> background&nbsp;music.</p>

<h3 class="paragraph_header"> CASE III: The Playlist (Fake Artists)</h3>
        <hr class="half-hr">
<p>One might argue that a certain amount of this is inoffensive. However, in addition to changing how we ascribe value to music, these playlists are undeniably affecting our interactions with &mdash; &amp; the
 <i>uses</i> of &mdash; musicians. Consider that many tracks on sponsored playlists are ghostwritten &mdash; <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s &#8220;fake artists&#8221; of infamy. But whether or not this is upsetting to you depends on your own vision of what our interactions with music should be. As <a href="shttps://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/07/10/spotify-fake-artists-real-artists-paid/">one cynical commentator</a> writes in support of the&nbsp;strategy,</p>
<p><blockquote class="quote">&#8216;Fake artists&#8217; are actually real artists […] [with] fake names that <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> listeners aren&#8217;t reading anyway. […] Show me the <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> listener that cares that their zen-like piano music wasn&#8217;t actually performed by <span class="person" about="Julius Aston">Julius Aston</span>. They don&#8217;t. […] Sorry you hate the fact that this &#8216;cheats&#8217; some struggling jazz artist who can&#8217;t get onto a&nbsp;playlist.</blockquote></p>

<p>Cynicism aside, the writer reminds us that there are actual people behind these tracks who are being remunerated, even if their contracts prevent them from being credited in a familiar way. Regardless, even a neutral stance toward &#8220;fake artists&#8221; must recognize that such a phenomenon is only achievable under a regime that prioritizes music&#8217;s use-value: musicians themselves are&nbsp;expendable.</p>

<p>Of course, there are repercussions for &#8220;real artists&#8221; too. Playlists that curate use-value appraise tracks on these terms, even in the case of artists who don&#8217;t wish to be assessed in such a way. Some might not even want to decontextualize their music from its original framing through inclusion on a playlist. While this is probably true of very few artists whose music is on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> to begin with &mdash; though we mustn&#8217;t forget the punishment for abstaining &mdash; the fact that industry needs triumph over the artist points to the state of music consumption, commodification, &amp; property relations&nbsp;today.</p>
<hr class="half-width">
<h3 class="paragraph_header">III. FUTURE: Discover Weekly, Ego Formation &amp;&nbsp;You</h3>

<figure class="article_2_4">
<img class="img-fluid article_images" src="imgs/article_2_4.jpg" id="fourth_image_second_article">
</figure>

<p>Whether or not we see these as positive or negative developments in the state of the industry, it&#8217;s not something that we can simply ignore. Nor does it show any signs of changing. Globally, users spend about half of their time on <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> consuming playlists, &amp; the centrality of features such as Discover Weekly continue to discourage active exploration &amp; secure the hegemony of the&nbsp;algorithm.</p>

<p>But though we can&#8217;t directly affect the trajectory of the music industry, we can radically modify our own behaviors to shift discourse &amp; reconstruct our relationships to corporations under&nbsp;capitalism.</p>

<p>Currently, a form of <i>passivity</i> is the expectation. It&#8217;s coded in the very jargon of producers &amp; consumers: the former is active, the latter passive. Corporate capitalism depends on our passivity, because it doesn&#8217;t just market to us; it seeks to shape us to achieve its own objectives. But that&#8217;s only possible when we embrace the idealized representations of advertising, i.e., the images we passively receive through corporate mediation. We maintain the conditions of capitalism &amp; reproduce its ideology when we identify &amp; reconstruct our identities in terms of the images on offer, which are carefully fabricated to catalyze ego formations &#8220;that [make] the product integral to the [consumer&#8217;s]&nbsp;identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s <span class="person" about="Jonah Peretti">Jonah Peretti</span> writing &mdash; yeah, the CEO of <span class="website" about="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</span>, way back when he was a wannabe anti-capitalist theorist. Ironically, he now strategically employs the very processes he once critiqued &mdash; to tremendous success. On <span class="website" about="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</span>, new ego formations are constantly stimulated by native advertising, sponsored quizzes,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>On <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, the emphasis on music&#8217;s use-value tricks the consumer into feeling they&#8217;re taking command of their consumption habits, where these are in reality constantly arbitrated by the vicissitudes of <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s own licensing policies, contractual obligations, &amp; financial interests. Not to mention the persuasive force of algorithmic recommendations in constructing the illusion of personal taste. A large part of <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>&#8217;s success hinges on making consumers feel themselves to be <i>active</i> agents, despite remaining generally <i>passive</i> recipients of content. Demand <i>passivity</i>; feign <i>activity</i>. It&#8217;s the 21st&nbsp;century.</p>
<p>But this situation defines the way out too. What&#8217;s important to remember is that identity reconstruction &amp; self-creation is emancipatory, when engaged <i>actively</i>. <span class="person" about="Gilles Deleuze">Deleuze</span> &amp; <span class="person" about="Felix Guattari">Guattari</span> found hope in this process of active self-creation early on. Although capitalism produces the current environment of globalization &amp; decontextualization by continually undermining the cultural &amp; symbolic obstacles that restrict exchange in order to facilitate the quick adoption of new ego formations &mdash; not to mention pave the way for the spread of American capitalism, culture, &amp; ideology &mdash; they nonetheless argue that actively accelerating this process destabilizes&nbsp;capitalism.</p>
<p>Acceleration means embracing new identity reconstructions without regard to the images marketed to us. It means we trade these images in favor of others too fickly to generate profit. It means we keep these images from tying us&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why the colonization &amp; centralization of the internet are so important: by mediating our online activity, corporations restrict our ability to actively recreate ourselves at the speed of data. Nonetheless, the internet&#8217;s emancipatory potential remains there. Though subjected to the tyranny of the algorithm, the internet search remains a potentially revolutionary constitutive act; when we choose to circumvent the algorithm, we play out a statement of identity in &amp; through the architecture of&nbsp;cyberspace.</p>
<p>Which means that, both inherently &amp; as a medium of music consumption, we mustn&#8217;t interact with the internet as a source of output, a relation that frames us as passive recipients &mdash; consumers. Rather, we should take pride in our constitution as <i>users</i> &mdash; active creators of new networks &amp; pathways of communication. We shouldn&#8217;t see the internet as just a source but a canvas &mdash; a space in which to perform our identities &amp; exercise our agency. We must become internet <i>users</i> once again. Accelerate entropy. Bring back&nbsp;anarchy.</p>
<p>Becoming a responsible, active internet user, for me, has meant abandoning <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span> entirely &mdash; just one step in the process of decentralizing my music consumption, decolonizing my online activity from any single corporate interest, &amp; rejecting dependence on the algorithm to shape my music taste &amp; online behavior more&nbsp;broadly.</p>
<p>For you, perhaps it means something different. That&#8217;s what emancipation is about. We don&#8217;t need to follow the same path &mdash; just go&nbsp;surf.</p></div>

<p id="ale3"><span class="first_letter">I</span>f you were on the internet at all in the past month you've no doubt heard of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. The cryptocurrency-based collectible market has exploded recently, with digital artworks in the form of JPEGs and GIFs <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqz73/beeple-nft-sells-for-dollar69-million-in-christies-auction">going for tens of millions of dollars</a> and musicians selling publishing rights on the blockchain. NFTs are hardly a new phenomenon, but given <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles">the immense amount of money</a> they’ve attracted in recent weeks, they’ve become a lightning rod for debate over art and capitalism.</p>


<p>British producer <span class="musician" about="Mura Masa">Mura Masa</span> participated in his first NFT exhibition at the beginning of March, and he was surprised to quickly see a massive bid on his digital artwork. One bidder offered 10 ETH, or about $15,000, for the <a href="https://zora.co/mura_masa/966">pointillist glyphs</a>, which the artist (whose real name is <span class="person" about="Alex Crossan">Alex Crossan</span>) created during the making of his 2020 album <span class="album" about="R.Y.C.">R.Y.C</span>. The bid was later removed, but the auction got the producer thinking about exactly who’s participating in the NFT marketplace and how value is ascribed to art.</p>

<p>“It's fair enough saying, ‘Oh yeah, NFTs are a way for finance bros to buy crypto art for ridiculous money,’ but it got me wondering about whether it's so ridiculous that these pieces should have such high market values,” he says. “The devaluation of art, music, creative work in general in the digital age is in my opinion a huge problem, and NFTs present a potentially interesting alternative to music streaming, etc.” </p>

<p><span class="person" about="Alex Crossan">Crossan</span>’s not alone in seeing NFTs as an opportunity for artists to find new ways to get paid. From critically-acclaimed electronic pop auteurs to Grammy Award-winning, stadium-headlining groups, more musicians than ever are experimenting with NFTs these days, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take away revenue streams such as touring and playing festivals. Canadian producer and singer <span class="musician" about="Grimes">Grimes</span> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph">sold a series of ten digital artworks</a> for $5.8 million on NFT market <span class="website" about="Nifty Gateway">Nifty Gateway</span>. Besides traditional platforms like <span class="streaming-service" about="Apple Music">Apple Music</span>, <span class="streaming-service" about="Spotify">Spotify</span>, and <span class="streaming-service" about="Amazon">Amazon</span>, rock band <span class="musician" about="Kings of Leon">Kings of Leon</span> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/kings-of-leon-when-you-see-yourself-album-nft-crypto-1135192/">made their latest album available</a> on <span class="streaming-service" about="YellowHeart">YellowHeart</span> as three types of tokens, which allowed fans to access perks including limited-edition vinyl and front row tickets to future concerts. </p>

<p>Some artists are even experimenting with selling the publishing rights to their work via NFTs. Canadian producer <span class="musician" about="Jacques Greene">Jacques Greene</span> <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/jacques_greene_is_selling_his_new_songs_publishing_with_blockchain">sold the publishing rights</a> to his song <span class="song" about="Promise">“Promise”</span> on <span class="website" about="Foundation">Foundation</span>. “I'm excited (and scared) of what possibilities and promises lie in this field, and for arts and culture in general," the producer <a href="https://twitter.com/jacquesgreene/status/1363625157554810883">wrote on Twitter</a>, also mentioning that he recently “got out of a long, pretty bad publishing deal.” His <span class="organization" about="LuckyMe">LuckyMe</span> labelmates, the duo <span class="band" about="TNGHT">TNGHT</span> (<span class="musician" about="Hudson Mohawke">Hudson Mohawke</span> and <span class="musician" about="Lunice">Lunice</span>), also <a href="https://foundation.app/LUCKYME/tnght-s-horn-sound-3178">sold an original horn sound</a> they created. This week, rapper <span class="musician" about="Azealia Banks">Azealia Banks</span> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9y4b/azealia-banks-sex-tape-album-nft">sold an audio sex tape NFT</a> for more than $17,000 on Foundation that included the right to resell it. </p>

<p>The exhibition <span class="person" about="Alex Crossan">Crossan</span> participated was a collaboration between entertainment company <span class="organization" about="IAMSOUND"><a href="https://www.iamsound.com/">IAMSOUND</a></span> and <span class="website" about="Zora"><a href="https://zora.co/">Zora</a></span> , a protocol which allows creators to mint, share, and exchange NFTs, and featured work from musicians and visual artists including <span class="musician" about="Toro Y Moi">Toro Y Moi</span> , <span class="musician" about="Yaeji">Yaeji</span>, <span class="person" about="David Rudnick">David Rudnick</span> , <span class="person" about="Jonathan Zawada">Jonathan Zawada</span> , and more.</p>
<p>“I think musicians have had a front row seat to what it means to really have zero ownership in the art that you create, and zero say in how that art is monetized,” <span class="website" about="Zora">Zora</span> co-founder <span class="person" about="Dee Goens">Dee Goens</span> said in an interview. “Back in the day, we had technology which allowed you to make music high-fidelity, you could remaster a song so it would sound better. Now we have technology that allows you to remaster the markets.” He and other co-founder <span class="person" about="Jacob Horne">Jacob Horne</span> left their jobs at cryptocurrency exchange <span class="organization" about="Coinbase">Coinbase</span> in the spring of 2020 to start the company, which originally started by selling limited edition physical merchandise like a cassette tape by electronic producer <span class="musician" about="RAC">RAC</span> and shoes by Nike designer <span class="person" about="Jeff Staples">Jeff Staples</span>. They were successful, but soon realized there was an opportunity to build a creator-focussed protocol that removed the need for any intermediaries. “ </p>



<p>This week, their team launched <a href="https://beta.catalog.works"><span class="streaming-service" about="Catalog">Catalog</span></a>, a music streaming service built on <span class="website" about="Zora">Zora</span>. It allows users to listen to songs for free, but they can also be purchased and resold as NFTs. The participating artists (there’s 20 right now) make 100% of sales, plus a self-determined share of every resale, without surrendering their copyrights. “Historically speaking media has been monetized by restricting access to it, you pay to buy a song with <span class="streaming-service" about="iTunes">iTunes</span>, you have to pay for a subscription to <span class="streaming-service" about="Netflix">Netflix</span>,” says <span class="person" about="Dee Goens">Goens</span>. “That is the idea that’s being disrupted right now.” </p>

<p>Clearly some artists and collectors see value in today's NFTs, but there's also a fair amount of criticism being levied against them. One common criticism is that most visual NFT art is bad and geared for profit in a cynical speculative market; another is that they <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ad9ww/nft-crypto-digital-blockchain-art-explainer">don't offer enough novelty</a> to justify the price tag; and still another: the underlying Ethereum blockchain that most NFTs exist on comes with an environmental cost due to the mining process that mints new ETH tokens as a reward for processing blocks of transaction data (which include NFTs). And then there is the problem of stolen works, since almost anything can in theory be tokenized by anyone, whether or not they actually created it.</p>

<p>Somebody who has been at the forefront of many conversations about the possibilities of new technologies in digital art is <span class="musician" about="Holly Herndon">Holly Herndon</span>. The <span class="place" about="Berlin">Berlin</span>-based electronic musican hosts the podcast Interdependence with her partner and longtime musical collaborator, <span class="musician" about="Matt Dryhurst">Matt Dryhurst</span> (who teaches at NYU’s <span class="organization" about="Clive Davis Institute">Clive Davis Institute</span>), which features interviews with people involved in music, technology, and politics. They’re also part of the artist collective Guild, which have been sharing resources and information about different Web 3.0 projects online.</p>
<p>“I think entities that are not providing value to artists are going to be challenged to either provide that value or get out of the way, because artists are having more tools to crew up and communicate with their audience directly and have more sovereignty over their own material,” said <span class="musician" about="Holly Herndon">Herndon</span>.

</p>

<p>At the same time, she understands artists’ disillusionment with the current NFT craze, which is seen by many as being led by craven speculators and profiteering tech investors. However, that doesn't tell the whole story. </p>

<p>"There’s a lot of talk from people like us who are talking about the collective potential and amazing possibility of this tech, and then people see a famous person sell a JPEG for a million dollars, and they’re a musician at home who have lost their viability to tour and it's really alienating," <span class="musician" about="Holly Herndon">Herndon</span> said. "It just feels like this popularity contest and I totally understand why there’s a disconnect between what this technology can do and the kind of attention certain projects are getting now." </p>

<p>"I really just think it's the early days," she added. "These are kind of the flashy, shiny things that happen early on that grab attention, but rest assured there are people doing really interesting shit that doesn’t get the same attention span because it's actually really friggin' complicated."</p>

<p>While <span class="musician" about="Holly Herndon">Herndon</span> and <span class="person" about="Alex Crossan">Crossan</span> are wary of the barriers involved with NFTs, including the environmental footprint inherent to Ethereum's proof-of-work blockchain, they recommend artists curious about it jump in with both feet and experiment.</p>

<p>“People are just going to be left in the dust if they refuse to come to grips with this in terms of it being a very important, dynamic shifting development,” said Crossan. “If you're not careful right now your kids are going to be exhaustedly explaining non-fungible cryptographic tokens to you.”</p>

<p id="advatari">According to <span class="musician" about="Holly Herndon">Herndon</span>, we should be encouraging experimentation with things that can move art to a more fair playing field. “I hope we can move past the platform paradigm that’s ruling all of our online lives right now, and move to something that’s more humane, more equitable, and creates communities in a healthier way and a more sustainable way,” she said.</p>
