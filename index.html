    <div class="coltext"><p>Music has a long relationship with writing and printing techniques: musical scores are as old as writing itself, going back to ancient Babylon, and have reached a wider diffusion after Gutenberg’s invention in the 15th century. However, it was only with the explosion of popular music from the 1930s onwards that an entire industry of music magazines, underground fanzines, and prestigious journalism was born. We at Resonance consider ourselves as contemporary heirs of this noble tradition. We are also in dialogue with coeval online magazines like Pitchfork, The Quietus, The Wire, or the Italian SentireAscoltare.

      Yet, with Resonance, we aim to offer a different idea of what a magazine could be, stretching the boundaries of this hundred-year-old definition. Resonance is a typographical experiment, that allows the reader to experience our articles’ selection through six different stylistic lenses. Digital technologies enable us to give a new spin to the reading experience, making it playful and creative. We are not only interested in the recreational side of things: with the Metadata Viewer, we aim to offer an enhanced reading experience, where entities, places, and other knowledge material can be easily recognized and studied by our readers!

        Born as the final project for the course 'Information Modeling and Web Technologies' at the University of Bologna, RESONANCE is tackling critical problems in the music industry today across its three issues. The first issue revolves around the dynamics of music distribution today thanks to digital tools, the second issue proposes new challenges to decolonize music history and the third focuses on the contribution of queer people to contemporary music. However, we still are a music magazine with people who love music and the readers can explore our taste in our Spotify Playlist.

                        <p class="issue">The last ten years have shaken music’s economy. After a long crisis, partially caused by pirate software like Napster or Soulseek, big companies have now integrated the streaming economy into their business model. Spotify has become a model for other players in the industry like Amazon Prime Music, Youtube Music, Apple Music, or Deezer. The digital market offered by these services is the largest ever and it seems like everybody can get their shot towards fame: you just need to get viral online and the fans will come. Yet, this model got many weak points: musicians are not paid enough, record labels are more needed than ever for advertising, the top artists got the largest part of revenues and the algorithm becomes the real decision-maker.
                            Moreover, in the sad pandemic world of 2020-21, streaming became the only revenue for many artists unable to play concerts and festivals. This issue of RESONANCE is dedicated to the complex and multi-layered world of the music economy, from Swedish billionaires to alternative underground models, trying to learn some lessons valid for the whole digital economic system we live in.

                       <p class="issue">Music is entangled with the historical developments and the social evolution of our specie. This means that music also shares a dramatic relationship with the colonial forces that despoiled the Global South. Most of the genres that are popular nowadays – techno, hip hop, rock – have originated within oppressed and colonized communities that have been barely recognized for their pioneering work. In recent years, this relationship has been inverted and many artists are trying to decolonize our culture also thanks to music contribution. It is time to change our perspective on music’s history. In the first article, we touch on the re-discovering of countries’ origins, like the African heritage in Brazilian music. The second and the third piece are dedicated to an even more radical quest, that is to challenge the way we perceive music and rhythms themselves. This issue of RESONANCE is a challenge to all the rules and stories we consider immutable or certainly true.

                      <p class="issue">SOPHIE, Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker and Anna Calvi. This issue is dedicated to telling the story of three of our era's most radical and interesting queer musicians. It is almost bland trivial to point out the extraordinary contributions of LGBTQ+ people to the history of popular music: legends like Freddie Mercury, Bowie or Elton John, as well as Jenis Joplin and Cyndi Lauper, have changed forever the music landscape we inhabit. This mutant and experimental tradition are well alive today and it’s every year more challenging to the industry’s rules. However, queer people's contribution to music has often been overlooked or dismissed as secondary and not decisive. In the third issue of RESONANCE, we are putting under the spotlight three incredible artists belonging proudly to the international queer community.
